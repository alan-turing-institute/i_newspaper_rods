Illustratitng the remarkable and altogether unparalleled phenomena created, the lecturer said that ashes hung like a pall over Batavia, 100 miles away; waves 70 feet high were raised on the coast of Java, and in the surrounding country there was immense loss of human life. The noise caused by the explosion, the biggest ever heard in the world's history, was conveyed to the mind of the audience by a map, showing that the sound trtavelled as far as the middle of Aus- tralia and across the Indian Ocean for 4000 miles. Small as Krakatoa vras itself, the eruption affected the whole earth, the air everywhere being stirred into a turmoil by the convul- sion, and enormous quantities of fine dust, raised from the molten pumice stone, being carried far and wide. Pictures were also produced of some of the beautiful sunsets which followed this aerial disturbance. In connection with the same subject, Sir Robert Ball exhibited by way of contrast, illustrations of Pompeii as seen before and after the great erruption of Vesuvius; and then proceeded to demonstrate the gradual in- crease of heat encountered as the earth's sur- face is penetrated. In explanation of the fact that the earth is gradually losing somo of its internal heat, he presented a series of pictures of the effects wrought by earth- quakes in different parts of the \u25a0world, to- gether with a map, which indicated, by means of rings, the particular districts in Great Britain which at various times have been affected by such shocks. The examples given were those of the Giant's Causeway, the rock on which Edinburgh Castle now stands, and Fingal's Cave, each formation being the acknowledged result of volcanic action experienced in ages long ago.", "id_issue": "0000164_19010102", "id_newspaper": "0000164", "page": "0005", "title": "THE EARTH AND ITS HEAT"}], "1901-01-05": [{"content": "HOW IT AFFECTED THE WORLD Xrakatoa made the loudest noise on record 17 years ago. . \u201e , Sir Robert Ball, in his lecture at the Royal Institution on Saturday, had a good deal to say about this noise, which wss the result of the greatest volcanic eruption ever known. Krakatoa is a tiny ialat, 10,000 miles away from England, in the Straits of Sunda. and in 1883 it created a record by the explosion which took place there and affected the wnole earth. The noiae wss the greatest ever heard, and was heard 5.000 miles away. Huge waves were set up in the sea, which carried ahips higli and dry on to Java and Sumatra; many livea were lost and damage done. Great air-waves diverged from the seat of the explosion, converged to the antipodes of Krakatoa, encompassed the globe seven times be- fore subsiding, and were perceived in Great Britaia. The huge red-hot blocks of pumice hurled out of the volcano knocked together and produced quantities of dust particles, which were carried far and wide over the entire earth and produced the gorgeous sunsets of the winter of 1883. Such eruptions, said Sir Robert, teach us that the interior of the earth is a great blaat furnace, the heat being tremendous. The esrth is now cooling, and tnerefore contracting daily This shrinking process gives rise to earthquakes, which occur when the crust of the earth is weak. Some years ago a great boring was made near X*eipsig, which went down to a greater depth than had ever been reached before. By means of a diamond drill a hole was bored in the earth to a depth of 150 yards over a mile. A thermometer waa let down to the bottom, and it was found that the temperature there was 80 degrees hotter than at the surface.", "id_issue": "0000518_19010105", "id_newspaper": "0000518", "page": "0008", "title": "THE LOUDEST NOISE ON RECORD."}], "1900-03-16": [{"content": "The will of the late Mr. T.

There is also the horse-power required for his holding to be hired, the cost of which is often a heavy item, sometimes absorbing any little profit which the smallholder ma\\ have off his limited quantity of produce, which in itself would be quite inadequate to feed anything but a very limited live stock. If skilled in gardening and in intensive cultivation, the location of the holding being favourable, ho could, of course, take up that line and (or) poultry rearing, but for the purpose of general agriculture and stock raising any acreage much less than 100 acres of land is not of much use, even to a skilled agriculturist, unless managed in conjunction with some side line, such as dairying or other business. _ . There appears to be much that is senti- mental and impracticable in the Ltopian scenes portraved by some po.iticians of \"smiling Highland valleys,\" now depopu- lated and turned into deer forests, and only awaiting the allocation of those lands by a particular party to become a home tor thousands of unemployed men. To put their theory to a practical test, a few of the advocates of the above proposal ought to acquire a few score acres in some of those depopulated uplands, and seriously endeavour, without their income being sup- plemented from any other source, to wrest a livelihood from the soil; and when in late autumn in those high altitudes, with unripened grain, as often happens, among pelting gusts of sleet and snow, I submit the politician making this experiment would then see no smile in that valley nor find one reflected from his own face, but he would at least have demonstrated to his own satis- faction, if he did not already know, that \" back to the land \" as a remedy for un- employment is only a political or other dream.\u2014l am, &c., bu- -25th December 1928.

What is the cause of it. I am in the Forfar im, I^ CHURCH UNION g: r \u2014Union is assumed to be for the Christian good of Scotland\"-a phrase often Tn the mouth of unionist spokesmen. The validity of that major premiss in their argument is open to question. Unionist committee men harp on the evangelise Scotland, and declare that union will achieve that result. Many of our people accept that opinion gospel. How, it may be asked, will it come about? Agencies will be readjusted rhurches will be closed down when they are StfSr 'he ts r sspssrt, \u00a3 country districts. The prestige is there \u2014and the endowments! \\et we are solemnly assured there will be no interference with the local rights of congregations. If that be so, what good end is to be served bj union T , , I am heartily in favour of union between U.F. congregations in districts where they are not self-supporting. Reasonable men would accept a condition that if their Church is aid receiving it be united with another, if possible. There is a wide field of activity still left in the U.F. Church for ecclesiastics to strengthen the position of our Church. It is an entirely different proposition to unite with a church that is established by law. However much committee men have camouflaged the position, the ugly fact emerges that the U.F. flock is being shepherded back into the Established Church fold. With the baits of \"union\" and \" the Christian good of Scotland\" they are being tempted to abandon the distinctive principles of their Church. It is vain to assure us that the Established Church has been completely changed by recent Acts of Parliament. I cannot see it. The cloven hoof will appear when the Royal Commission occupies the throne of the first united Assembly, and hands the Royal charges! Voluntaries don't like to have any truck with an institution of that sort. It is insinuated by a contemporary of yours that the minority are seeking the disestablishment and disendowment of the National Church. Nothing of that kind! They only wish to remain in an unprivileged Church on the basis of religious equality. We are told we are dwelling among mouldy traditions, looking backward, not thinking of the future. On the contrary, it is the majority who are so doing. They bow be- fore the fetish of \"national religion, and cherish the anachronism of a \" .National Church.\" We look to the future not the past, and we are convinced that *ree Church principles are as good for our children as for us. See how young nations on the Continent are starting on their career on the basis of the separation of Church and State! The latest instance is the little State of Latvia. If the truth be told, this union movement is largely an intrigue of ecclesiastics \u2014 Church highbrows\u2014and of ministers with their too subservient elders to make a financial success of the Church. The people are apparently quite indifferent, one way or the other. Let us hope they will wake up before their birthright is filched from them . let they\u2014poor fools\u2014will not be asked to register their decision. The powers that are protest that it would not be constitutional to have a referendum on this question. \" We are Presbyterians, say they, \" not Congregationalists!\" Never- theless, this union can only be satisfactorily settled by the vote of the democracy. The minority need not be discouraged. They have only to sit tight, claim to be \"the United B'ree Church of Scotland\" at the crucial moment, and when their rights are challenged let the Law Courts decide. The leaders of the U.F. majority in 1900 threatened to starve out the minority (I saw the threat in print), but in 1904 the boot was found to be on the other leg! History sometimes repeats itself!\u2014l am, &c., Old U.P. Glasgow. TEMPERANCE (SCOTLAND) ACT Sir, \u2014May I suggest that the liquor problem is vitiated by misuse of the word temperance, coupled with the fact that the voice of \" temperate use,\" as such, has no possibility of expression under the existing \" resolutions\" of the Temperance (Scotland) Act, 1913. % An elector who uses alcoholic beverages in moderation la a temperate user, or a temperance person, and, by that \" temperate use\" he, or she, sets an example which everv responsible member of society in general, and all public-spirited purveyors of .Icoholic beverages, approve. Disapproval seems to be confined to out and-out no-license advocates. All propaganda pro- motive of \"temperate use' is of value to the body corporate. Meantime, unfortunately, a number of organisations employ the word \" tem- perance\" in their titles; their object being, not \" temperate use\" of alcoholic beverages, but total abolition of liquor licenses and nothing less. One upshot is unjust classifica- tion of \"temperate users\" with \"excessive consumers,\" another is the illusion that no-license advocates approve \" temperate u <e of alcoholic beverages\"; the situation as' a whole constituting a masquerade giving rise to resentment, confusion, and worse. The Temperance (Scotland) Act pollings of the last nine years have combined to stress the need for complete clarity in designation of propaganda movements operating relative to these pollings. A very explicit expression of Scottish public opinion is needed at the polls. There is required a \"resolution\" on the ballot paper, designed to appeal to \" temperate users\" of alcoholic beverages, which \" resolution\" should per- mit indication of such improvement, or ex- periment, in conditions of sale, within reason, as the voice of \" temperate use\" may desire to see carried out. The exclusion of the word \"temperance\" from the title of movements working for no-license\" would pave the way for a Scot- tish temperance movement having for its object the promotion of \"temperate use\" of alcoholic beverages so long as such beverages remain a pqpular feature of social life. \u2014I am, &c., Eldred H.

I did not observe the particular phenomenon of Saturday's sunset referred to by your correspondent in yesterday's issue, but Friday's sunset was exceptionally fine. One wonders if the recent volcanic eruptions in Italy have been so violent as to cause sunset displays similar to those which followed the remarkable Krakatoa eruption of the year 1883. On that occasion immense quantities of pumice, ashes, and the finest dust were thrown into the atmosphere. The finest particles remained for a long time floating in the upper currents of the air, and were carried all over the earth. The presence of this impalpable volcanic dust caused a peculiar glow in the sky at sunrise and sunset for several months in almost every country in the world. Rain and snow which fell thousands of miles from the scone of the eruption were found to contain the same materials as those form- ing the ashes from Krakatoa. Should there be a continuance of brilliant sunsets, one might be justified in arguing similar effects from similar causes It may interest some of your readers to know that the planet Jupiter was plainly visible here on Thursday last at 3.30 p.m.\u2014 I am, &c., Observer.

We have not heard very clearly on what grounds their conclusions were based, but experience of the action of past volcanio outbursts is enough to warn those who may at present be inclined to make too close a survey of Mount Pelee of the danger in- volved. In any of the great eruptions the disturbance generally continues on a rather formidable scale ,for days and weeks, and occasionally explosions occur months after the first blast. A crater of the situation of Mount Pelee is just one where repeated outbursts are to be feared. Wholly sur- rounded as Martinique is by the waters of the Caribbean Sea and placed in the centre of an active volcanic region, the island may not have been subjected to anything like its worst upheaval. The disturbance is not comparable to that which distinguished the literal blowing to pieces of Krakatoa, in the East Indies, in 1883. Then, as in the present eruptions in Martinique and St Vincent, the outburst was caused by the force of steam. Had there been a Watt among the scientific geniuses of the first century the cause of the eruption of Vesuvius, when Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried, might have been turned to account as indicating the possibilities of the power of steam. Instead, however, of realising the potentialities of the under- ground fcree which nip ted huge mountains, the scientists of those days had evidently been impressed rather with superstitious awe. No doubt can longer exist, Professor Bonney has declared, that steam is the main explosive in volcanic eruptions. It was computed by an eminent scientist who studied the eruption of Etna in 1865 that the mountain in one hundred days dis- charged as steam nearly three million cubic yards of water. It is difficult to under- stand how the water reaches the burning mass in the volcano in view of the enor- mous underground pressures. The fact re- mains that water does percolate to great depths and apparently against high pres- sures. That vast masses of water are still finding their way into the volcanic cham- bers of Martinique and St Vincent is by no means improbable, with the result that the repeated explosions are caused, as it were, by the bursting of subterranean boilers in which the pressure has become too great for the mass of rock above to re- sist.", "id_issue": "0000164_19020522", "id_newspaper": "0000164", "page": "0004", "title": ""}, {"content": "A Q ; e !?%e!! ,e t Duty \u00b0 f AH. fe\u00b0r s?<? n^ is gives h!?*an iS Ve ?\" sbort \" Cfy a U( j ?

The gentleman who Avas pushing the contrivance happened to mention that another much smaller line was also considering the ques- tion of fitting it to their rolling-stock. Ibis information afforded the manager of the big line an idea. Asked he, \" What will be their outlay in fitting the experimental brakes r \"Say ,\u00a3300.\" \"Well,\" said that manager, \"offer to bear a third of that expense your- self, and I will hand you a cheque for \u00a3100. The proposition was made and accepted. The contrivance waA tried, and proved to be a failure, and sothe big Company, profiting by the other's experience, learned a lesson that was -worth fliousands of pounds at the cost of only one hundred. Not long since a new Judge was appointed to a certain County Court, and solicitors practising there were not a little curious as to what would prove to be the best methods for \" getting on with\" the fresh comer. The Judge looked a master- ful kind of man, but one gentleman who would appear before him had heard it wrhis- pered that if -only you stood up to him he was far Jess terrible than he appeared. Eager to 'test the truth of this, but deter- mined to run no risks, the artful one singled out a legal brother who promised to become a likely victim, and imparted to him the ad- vice,\" Don't be afraid of him: give him as good as he gives you.\" And a little later, as the plotter heard the Judge cutting that young man up for his temerity, rending his arguments to pieces, and turning his con- tentions and submissions inside out, he hugged his knees beneath the bench at which he sat. and chuckled because his experiment- ing had been performed by proxy.\u2014Cassell's Saturday Journal. Green Moons and Strange Sunsets. At the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, a mass of matter, estimated at about 1J cubic mile in bulk, waf hurled into the air in the form of capilli ashes, and the finest volcanic dust. A series of barometrical disturbances passed round tihe globe, in opposite directions from the volcano, at the rate of about 700 miles an hour. The air wave, travelling from east to west, is supposed to have passed three and a quarter times round the earth (or 82,200 miles) before it ceased to be percep- tible. The sea in the neighbourhood was thrown into waves, one of which was- com- puted to have risen more than 100 feet above tide level, destroying towns, villages, and 36,380 people. Oscillations of the water were perceptible even at Aden\u2014looo miles distant; at Port Elizabeth, in South Africa \u20145450 miles; and among the islands of the Pacific Ocean; and they are computed to have travelled with a maximum velocity of 467 statute miles in the hour. Thpse who are old enough will remember tlio \"wonderfully beautiful eunsets w r hich were visible all over Europe in the autumn of 1883. Many men of science asserted that these were due to minute particles of volcanic material from Krakatoa floating far away in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and occasioning an abnormal refraction of the sun's rays. Dur- ing the same period the moon at times ap- peared to be of a green colour, which effect, it was asserted, was also due to Krakatoa. It should be here remarked, howeyer, that the connection between these wonderful sun- sets and the eruption of Krakatoa was not admitted by' many people. Consequently, the great recording all the observations upon Krakatoa, whicn was published under the auspices of the Royal Society, was en- titled \" Krakatoa and Subsequent Pheno- mena.\"\u2014Geilcie's \"Text Book of Geology.\" \" If I were King.\" I should abolish early-rising, and discour- age all hard work.

The ever-growing demand for lady nurses for childran is the proof that they supply a real need. From the mother's point of view it is extremely desirable to have the influence of a refined gentlewwoman over her children, so that they may not learn in the nursery habits of speech and behaviour which have to bo eradicated later on. From the nurse's point of viTw it is also exceedingly satis- factory, because, while the care of children is a congenial occupation to l most women, the salary received is good, the training inex- pensive, and the position a fairly independent one. There are several institutions where gentlewomen can receive an efficient training as children's nurses. One of these is the Princess College at Kersal, near Manchester, where the students are initiated into the mysteries of tow to hold and how not to hold a. baby, and many other important things. Probationers are not admitted un#ler twenty years of age, and mu6t be resident in the College. They are all gentlewomen by birth, no matter what station in life, owing to circumstances, their parents may happen to be filling at tbe time of their application. The fees for twenty-three weeks' residence, board, laundry, and tuition amount to .\u00a34O. In some few suitable coses the whole, or abor- tion, of this is advanced from the Loan Train- ing Fund, and is repaid in instalments out of the first salary received, uniform being sometimes provided on the same terms. There is never auy trouble in getting situations for the \"Princess Christian \" nurses; on the Contrary, the difficulty is to supply them, owing to the large number of applications re- ceived. They never go tut single-handed, but always where an under-nurse is ke&\u00a3, and for the first two years still remain under the control of the College. The lowest salary they receive is fixed at .\u00a325 per annum, whiteh is paid direct to the treasury of the College. The holders of,a special certificate, which is given after five years' satisfactory work as nurse, are enabled to ask \u00a3-10 per annum.\u2014 Lady's Magazine.

On Saturday evening, a gentleman named Edmands, of Hastings, was found in a dying condition at a lonely spot on the Crumbles Beach, Eastbourne. He was in a pool of bloocl, and a large knife was found near the spot. He was removed to the Princess Alice Hos- pital. Isaac Wood, a weaver, of Thornton, near Bradford, was, late on Sunday night, beaten to death by Jonas Drake, a collier belonging to Bradshaw, a village near Halifax. It is asserted that Wood was caught by Drake in company with the wife of the latter, and Drake immediately fell upon him with such fury as to cause fatal injuries. Drake has been arrested. At Staines Parish Church, on Sunday morning, some excitement was caused immediately after the publica- tion of banns of marriage by the Kev. J. H. Armstrong, vicar, bv a man standing up and saying in a loud voice, \" I forbid the banns.\" At the conclusion of the service he saw the Vicar in the vestry, and it then appeared that he objected to his daughter's marriage on the ground that she was under age. Some startling revelations of overcrowding in the city of Waterford have been made at the local police- court. It was proved that in four tenement houses the sanitarv officer found no fewer than one hundred and thirtv-one human beings and a horse, which shared the room of one oi the inmates. A family of eight were found in a little room not larger than would safelv accommodate two persons. The Most Rev. Edward O'Dwyer, Roman Catholic Bishop of Limerick, addressing a* large congregation at Partien on Monday night, on the occasion of the closing of a mission, made some strong and emphatic observations in condemnation of moonlighting, secret societies, and other agencies tending to affect injur- iously the religion and morals of the people. He coun- selled moderation and avoidance of violence, or impru- dent action of any kind. Private Kelly, of the 3rd Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who decamped on Saturday with \u00a3120, the pay money of the regiment, was apprehended some few miles from Wrexham the same evening. Another man named Davies, who was in league with Kelly, was also caught and locked up. Both men were brought before the Wrexham Borough Bench on Monday, and sentenced to six months' hard labour each. Only A'so of the money has been recovered. In the Queen's Bench Division, on Monday, an action was mentioned, brought by Sir T. Hesketh and Earl Poulett, as trustees under a desd executed by the late Lord Haldon, to recover from Mrs. Eleanor Vernon possession of Exminster House, Exniinster. The defendant asserted that the house was given her by the late Lord Haldon, who seduced her when she wc,s a young girl, and by whom she had a child in 1865. The case was adjourned for the plaintiff's pleadings to be amended. Dr. Donnet, physician to the Lunatic Asylum of Bordeaux, tells us \"that a great deal of wine is drunk in Bordeaux. Rich people pride themselves 011 their taste in wines, and men in good positions are fre- quently met with who drink rather more than two- and-a-half pints at every meal. On this account disorders of the circulation, stomach, liver, or kidneys are common, and statistics prove that thpre are more deaths from apoplexy in Bordeaux than in any other town in the world.\u2014London Mediral Record. Dr. Andrew Wilson, in his \" Notes by the Way,\" records a singular incident in connection with the action of bee stings. A woman had suffered so much from rheumatism that for six months she had hardly slept. Her right arm was so affected that it was quite useless. Having learned of the effects of the acci- dental sting of a bee in a similar case, three bees were obtained and made to sting her on the arm. The success of this treatment was surprising and complete, and on the following night she was able to sleep and the acute pain had altogether disappeared. Lord Salisbury visited the Constitutional Club on Saturday, and unveiled a statue of Lord Abergavenny, its founder. After paying a tribute to the services which Lord Abergavenny had rendered to the Conser- vative party, the noble Marquis urged the importance to them of organisation. Their opponents had the Nonconformist Chapels and the Labour organisations as centres of political influence; but as the Church of England, to which Conservatives were mainly allied, could not be political, they must make the best use they could ol their Constitutional and Conservative Clubs. A blast of 100,000 tons of rock took place at Llan- beris Quarry, Carnarvonshire, at one o'clock on Satur- day, two tons of gelatine, equal to nineteen tons of powder, being employed. The police had issued a notice cautioning the inhabitants to keep clear, and thousands retired to the slopes of Snowdon. Windows were opened, pier glasses removed, and other precau- tions taken. The result, however, proved that tliese were not necessary. The explosion was, to the fullest degree, successful, but no great dispersion of stones and debris was made. The rock was shattered and brought down in a mass into the quarry workings and lake below. The news from Darmstadt of the serious illness of the Princess Victoria, eldest daughter of the late Princess Alice and Louis the Fourth of Hesse, is of th.a gravest character. Anxiety as to the progress of the malady will be extreme. As yet, the illness is only spoken of as causing apprehension, but the gastric fever which was the first diagnosis of the disease appears to have assumed a phase of typhus. The Princess Victoria was born at Windsor Castle on the sth April, 1853, and she was married to Prince Louis of Battenberg on April 30th, 1884. There is one child of the marriage, the Princess Alice, born on February 25th, 1885. Ann Hughes, a farmer's daughter, living near Pen- maentnawr, was on Monday charged before the Con- way magistrates with having poisoned her sister by giving her a dose of rat poison in tea. The two sisters were on bad terms, and the charge against the accused, who had been nearly a fortnight in custody, was based upon a statement made by the deceased, who died after a three days' illness.\" The Coroner's jury had returned an open verdict. On Monday, the police re- ported that as the county analyst had failed to dis- cover anv trace of poison in the viscera, it was useless to proceed with the case. The prisoner was, therefore, discharged. The official authority for the release of the Rev. James Bell-Cox did not reach Walton Gaol until eleven o'clock on Saturday morning, by which time the rev. gentleman's friends, who had assembled at an early hour, had dispersed. Mr. Cox at once left the gaol, and drove home unaccompanied. A very large congre- gation assembled at St. Margaret's, Liverpool, on Sun- day morning in anticipation of the appearance of Mr. Cox.. The rev. gentleman attended the morning service, but bpyond announcing the hymns took no part in the service, except that before the sermon a brief request was made by him to \" return hearty thanks to Almighty God for His great mercy vouch- safed to us.\" Holiday Reflections. \u2014With the approach of Whitsuntide the mind seems naturally to turn to anticipations of Swiss climbing and Rhine experiences, the remembrances of which go so far to make the re- mainder of our English year bearable. Talking of the Rhine, one of, perhaps, the moat pleasant experience! to the traveller is\u2014next to the contrast in the scenery \u2014the change in the style of living which his holiday there induces him to. Take the matter of wine alone. How his knowledge of that article seems to be suddenly enlarged by the light refreshing bottle of Hochheimer, which he gets\u2014say at St. Goar or Coblentz \u2014and which he mentally resolves, shall, in future, appear on hit table at home. Circumstances have, it is true, hither- to prevented the realisation of this resolution, but, in future, the new scheme of Messrs. W. and A. Gilbey, for supplying the light table wines _ of Germany and Hungary\u2014Hochheimer and Karlowitr \u2014at One Shil- ling per bottle, should do much to meet what is \u2022 rapidly-growing demand. \u2014The Morning Post, Slit May, 1887.

At the Central Criminal Court, on Tuesday, Meahaok Lee, a gipsy, was sentenced to penal servitude for lifa for a fiendish assault upon a little girl at Ealing. At a meeting in Dublin, on Tuesday, at which letters were read from Lord Hartington and Mr. Chamber- lain, a Liberal Unionist Club was formed for that city. Replying to a correspondent, who asked Sir Edward Birkbeck whether it is nis intention to persevere with the Pure Beer Bill, Sir Edward says he decidedly in- tends to do so. The Press Association is informed that Mr. Parnell's health is much improved, and there is no reason to doubt that on the reassembling of Parliament he will be able to resume his duties. The steamer, Harkaway, of London, foundered on Tuesday morning during the gale off the Smalls, and thirteen persons on board, including the captain's wife and two children, went down with the vessel. George Francis Train says that when he stopped eat- ing meat, thirteen years ago, and began living on fruit and grain, he weighed 2101b. Ho now weighs 1801bs. He has not been ill an hour since he ceased eating meat A fatal fire occurred during Saturday night at F.arlslield House, Bath-road, Hounslow. A middle- aged lady named Miss Annie Howe was found in a room with the upper part of her body burnt to a cinder. The City Press states that the Jubilee ball at the Guildhall will be held oil Coronation-day, the 28th prox., subject to the approval of her Majesty and the Court authorities. There will be about six thousand guests. The promotions in honour of the birthday of the Queen are not expected to be so numerous this year, and many announcements will be kept back until after the Jubilee. Her Majesty has, however, already pro- moted a number of Colonial representatives. M. P. Aumont won the French Derby on Sunday with Monarque, Baron A. de Schickler's Krakatoa being second, and M. M.

The United Kingdom Alliance has received through its President, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, a donation of \u00a31,000 for the Alliance funds. The donor does not allow his name to be mentioned, but sends the gift \"in memory of a mother's interest in the temperance cause.\" The death is announced, at Norwich, of Sergeant George Wilde, one of the survivors of the famous Balaclava charge, in which he had three horses killed under him. In addition to his Crimean career, Wilde served with distinction in one of the Maori wars in New Zealand. Sir A. 1). Walker, Bart., of Gateacre, Liverpool, on Tuesday unveiled a bronze bust of the Queen, after a model by Count Gleichen, which he has presented to the village. The hon. baronet also publicly presented an Institute to the inhabitants for intellectual and social purposes. At the annual conference on Saturday of the North Wales Quarrvmen's Union, it was reported that the quarry trade in North Wales was extremely bad, the only quarries working full time being Llanberis. It was stated that men were emigrating wholesale, and that great distress prevails. The Jubilee Service at Westminster Abbey, like the Thanksgiving Services at St. Paul's, will have a com- Elete representation of the working man element. The iord Chamberlain has intimated to Mr. George Potter that representatives of the labouring classes will bo ad- mitted to the number of sixty. Some influential members of the House are taking part in an effort to induce the Home Secretary to re- invest with the franchise three thousand three hundred and thirty-two Gloucester electors scheduled for corrupt practices in 1880. The memorialists suggest that this political amnesty should take place in the Jubilee year. The Goldsmiths' Company have determined to mark the Jubilee of her Majesty by subscribing \u00a35,000 for the purposes of a public recreation ground at Acton, and \u00a31,000 to the Imperial Institute, and by making gifts to the occupants of their almshouses at Acton, Hackney, and Woolwich, and to the cottagers and others upon their estate in Sussex. A lad of fourteen, named John Coker, was brought up at the Central Criminal Court, on Monday, for sen- tence. At last sessions, he pleaded guilty to placing an iron chair upon the South-Western Bailway near Twickenham. A train passed at the rate of thirty miles an hour, and the obstruction was forced for a considerable distance along the line, tearing up the permanent way. The prisoner concealed himself on the embankment to see the result. He was sentenced to six months' hard labour. Mr. W. O'Brien addressed a meeting at Kingston, Canada, on Friday evening, and on his way back to his hotel was attacked by a mob, which also, during the night, broke the windows of some Irish and Roman Catholic establishments. O'Brien is said to be suffer- ing from a blow he received at Toronto. As Mr. O'Brien was leaving a meeting he had addressed at Hamilton, Ontario, oil Monday night, he was pelted, and during the drive to his hotel eight shots were fired at him. He was not injured, but the driver of the carriage was hurt in the wrist. Two boys, named Cotton and Marshall,'each twelve years of age, were charged before the Manchester stipendiary, on Tuesday, with using threats to another boy named Keirnon. It appeared that Cotton had been dismissed from a situation which the prosecutor now held, and early in the morning the prisoners went to the shop, and Cotton, producing a revolver, pointed at Keirnon, and threatened to kill him. The prosecu- tor, however, raised such an alarm as to bring assist- ance, and the prisoners were given into custody. They were bound over to keep the peace. In a fog off the coast of the United States, two steam- ships of the White Star Line, the Celtic and the Britannic, came into collision. The settling of the latter vesssl, immediately on receiving the blow, which tore a large hole in her side, excited the fear that she was foundering. Several boat-loads of passengers were accordingly transferred to the Celtic, and afterwards both vessels proceeded incompany, joined by two other British ships, to New York. The names of four pas- sengers who were killed are given; but others are miss- ing, and it is believed that the loss of life will prove to be larger. The Press Association Swansea correspondent states with regard to Mr. Gladstone's forthcoming visit to South Wales, that it has been finally arranged that the demonstration at Singleton shall be held on June 4, when it is expected that there will be not less than 20,000 persons present. The workmen employed at the Landore Seimens Steel Works intend presenting Mr. Gladstone with a steel axe. The coalworkers will give him a lump of coal, on which an address of welcome will be inscribed in gold letters, and other presenta- tions of an equally interesting character are reported to be in preparation About one o'clock on Tuesday morning, another outrage\u2014the third within three weeks\u2014was perpetrated at Hebburn, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the police-station being the object of attack. The outrage seems to have been a most determined affair. The explosive used was, apparently, dynamite or gun-cotton, and the quantity must have been considerable. Great damage has been done to the interior of the building, doors and windows having been wrecked, and bolts and locks shattered. A portion of the fuse which was attached to the explosive has been found by the polioe. A man was arrested on suspicion, but afterwards released. Mr. John Aloysius Blake, M.P. for Carlow, died on Sunday morning suddenly after breakfasting in the public rooms at Queen's Anne's Mansions, London. The hon. member had beeu advised only a few days ago that he was suffering from an affection of the heart, which would make it prudent for him to with- draw from the excitement of Parliament. He appeared, however, to be in excellent spirits, and there was no premonition of the fatal event, which had to be broken to Mrs. Blake ou her return from Church. Mr. Blake, who was in his sixty-first year, was one of the most moderate members of the Irish Nationalist Party. Father Kelleher was released from Kilmainham on Saturday night, the Court of Appeal having decided that his committal for contempt by the Court of Bank- ruptcy was irregular. News of the release quickly spread, and * large crowd assembled, and cheered en- thusiastically as the carnage drove to the Imperial Hotel. On the receipt of the intelligence at Cork, torchlight and bonfire displays were organised. At Youghal and Qiieenstown there were similar demonstrations, bands of music also parading the streets. On Tuesday' Justice Boyd ordered the release of Father Ryan and Mr. Slattery, who were also im- prisoned for contempt of court. A sad calamity occurred in the estuary of the Dee during the gale of last week. A Dee lighter, com- manded by Captain Foster, and having on aboard his sou and an ordinary seaman, was struck by the gale and foundered. The three men lashed themselves to a mast which remained above water, and in this position they for four hours were exposed to terrible hailstorms, the sea at times washiug clean over them. At length the mast broke, aud the captain and his son were both drowned, but the seaman was rescued. Since then the ship has been gradually settling down. Oa Tuesday she had sunk level with the sands at low water; at high water she is submerged. In another week she will have disappeared. I hear, writes a London correspondent, that there is great grief at the Holse Guards over the cutting down of the Army Estimates, in compliance with the demands of Mr. Gosclien. It is asserted by those who ought to know the facts, that only one of the two Army Corps on which we are to depend, if a European war should break out, is provided with transport, and that the cavalry division would be unable to move beyond the beach of any shore on which it might be landed. To put the whole force in a thoroughly satis- factory condition another one hundred thousand pounds is needed ; but in the present temper of Parlia- ment, it is not the least likely that this sum, even if asked for by Mr. Stanhope, would be granted. Two women, named Lily Fairhurst and Mary Bannis- ter, were on Monday charged before the Manchester Stipendiary with conspiring to defraud. It appeared that the prisoners some time ago set up a Servants' Registry Office in that city, and inserted several very tempting advertisements in the local newspapers, offer- ing high wages to young women as general and other servants. It was proved in evidence that, although in the case of five advertisements there were really vacant situations, yet the prisoners accepted fees on account of these alone from nearly forty applicants. When the prisoners first came before the magistrates the precincts of the Court were crowded by women who de- clared they had been victimised. The prisoners were committedjfor trial. In the Queen's Bench Division, on Saturday, Mrs. Rosa Ellen Gillingwater, a widow of forty years, who formerly carried on a business in Upper-street, Isling- ton, sued Mr. Goddard, a widower of sixty, to recover damages for breach of promise of marriage. The de- fendant, who Is an architect in the service of the Board of Works, pleaded that the promise, if made, was con- ditional on the marriage of his daughter, which bad not come off. It was stated that the children of the parties called plaintiff and defendant papa and mamma. Many affectionate letters passed between the parties, in one of which he expressed his belief that the de- parted Gillingwater, if he were permitted to know any- thing of this state, would approve of all he wished to do. The case, which promised some amusement, was nipped in the bud by an agreement, the terms of which were not revealed. \" No Bbbadabt so Man,\" is an old saying, but those who cannot take a better morning meal, will find Cad- bury's Cocoa a pure refined beverage\u2014comforting, ex- hilarating, and sustaining.

China.\u2014A serious riot, due to the feeling of hostility to foreigners, has occurred at Canton. In the course of the disturbance much property was destroyed, and in view of the threatening aspect of the natives the European residents took refngs en board the steamers in the river. Two gunboats left Hong Kong on Tuesday for Canton to protect life and property. So far as reported there was no loss of life among the foreign residents during the riot. According to the latest intelligence from Canton tranquillity was restored there. A despatch received in Paris from Ilong Kong gives an account of the occurrences at Canton, according to which the riot was caused by a group of Portuguese killing a Chinaman. The mob, infuriated by this deed, set Are to several houses belonging to foreigners, bnt no Kurope&n was killed, though the Chinese autliorities were slow in repressing the disturbance. France.\u2014A French officer, Major Senaux, of the 134 th Regiment, while commanding some light infantry movements in the Haute Mnrne, was shot in the temple while talking to bib adjutant and fell dead. There was no ball practice, as the morning papers report, and therefore there is great suspicion that he was murdered. The Comte de Chamlonfs Will.\u2014The Vienna corres- pondent of the Daily A'ewe gives particulars of the con- tents of the \"authentic will\" ef the late Comte de Chambord. The document is written, he says, in the fount's own hand. It is dated the 4th of June, and is not signed by witnesses, the Austrian law not dreaming that these were absolutely necessary. It contains no political allusions, but only the arrangements affecting tlie Chambord property, and declares the testator to be at peace with all men, even those who offended him. I'be property consists of four domains\u2014viz., those of I'hanibord in France, St Hubert in Bonat, Hungary, one domain in Galicia, Frohsdorf, and a small ehdleau in Ntyria, besides eight million florins in personal property. The Comtesse de Chambord is to have the full enjoymeut oi all the property excepting the subsequent bequests. After the Countess's death the entire property is to go to the Count's nephews\u2014one-third to Count Bardi, and two-thirds to the Duke of l'arina. The Count bequeaths to his two nieces, the (Jrand Duchesses of Parma and Toscana, half a million francs each, and to the Lyons Institute for propagating the Catholic faith 500,000fr. 40t),000fr. are to be invested for the Pope, the yearly interest to be Peter's pence contributed by the Comte de L'hambord. To the poor of Paris he leaves 100,000 francs, and to the poor of the place wherein he died 20,00') francs. The legacies to the poor are payable immediately. Certain sums are reserved for the reading of a certain number of masses for the late Count's soul. All the servants are to receive pensions. The Spanish Princes are not even alluded to. Admiral Pierre died at noon on Tuesday at Marseilles. He will be chiefly remembered in connection with the re- cent bombardment of Tamatave, and the painful incidents of the arrest ef Mr. shuw for \" giving intelligence to the tnemy,\" and of the Admiral's alleged discourtesy to the late Mr. Consul Pakenhaut in that gentleman's dying moments.

Capr Coast Castlk, Aug. 13 (oid Liverpool).\u2014 Messengers arrived here to-day from tlie King of Becqnay to request the intervention of the Colonial Uovernment between Koffee Kalcalli, who has seined the throne, and the party of the ex-King Mensah. Severe fighting, as already announced by cable, took place \u00abn the 3d and 4th instant, and when the messengers left both parties were preparing for another encounter. Kalcalli is reported to have had only seven men killed, while Measah lost 60, including many of his principal supporters. The people of Coomassie dread the return of Koffee Kalcalli, as they were active in dethroning him in 1874. The King of Becquay, who is neutral between the contending parties, has intervened in the hope of preserving Coomassie, which he fears will be depopulated by the new tyrant.

The Bulgarian Liberals wished the Prince to form a coalition Ministry, and retnrn to the old Consti- tution, which he had violently abolished, the Russian generals, according to this plan, retaining their posts in the new Ministry. Prince Alexander rejected this pro- posal, and after a stormy interview with the Czar's Special Envoy, M. Jonion, requested the two Russian Mini stern, Generals Soboleff and Kalubarse, to lay down their portfolios, and ordered the Bulgarian Conservative leader, M. Grecoff, to form a new Ministry. Thereupon General fSoboleff, acting on direct orders from the Czar, called on the Prince and refused to take his dismissal. 1 his the Russian followed up by presenting an ultimatum, the principal terms of which were the demission of his full powers by the Prince, the practical dictatorship of the Russian generals, and the convocation of a con- stituent assembly under their auspices to draw up a new Constitution. After contemplating abdication and vainly appealing to the Powers, the Prince has finally decided to yield, and has privately signed a manifesto embodying the Russian conditions. The publication of the manifesto is, however, deferred till the Prince's fit* day, a week bcuce. In spite of this concession the tension is such that the abdication of the Prince seems to me to be inevitable.\" In a later message the correspondent adds : \u2014\" The irritation among the Bulgarian national leaders it the Prince's surrender and abject humiliation is intense. One leading politician remarked to me, ' The Prince by his incapacity has converted Bulgaria into a Uussian province.' The question of the Prince's depo- sition will possibly be laid before the Constituent Assembly. The Prince has been for days practically a prisoner in his own palace, it being impossible for him publicly to meet the Minister whom he has dismissed, and who has refused to take his dismissal. The language used to him by the Russian Special Envoy passed all bounds.\" Java.\u2014An official despatch to the Hague aunounces that the passage of the Sunda Strait is clear, the only change in its physical features having occurred between the Krakatoa Islands and Seboekoe. The Eeratepunt lighthouse is intact, and the Vlakehoek light- house will be lit within a week.

A terrible atory, says the Japan Weekly Mail, eomes by telegram from Hiroshima. It Is to the effect that on the night of the 3d nit., at about 10 o'clock, a Are broke out at the gaol and spread with such rapidity that all the buildings from the first to the twelfth ward were destroyed in a very short space of time. In each ward from 30 to SO criminals are confined, and it is stated that the oocupants of the fourth and fifth wards, 01 per- sons in afl, were bnrned to death, while 156 prisoners wore more or less severely injured. One hundred and twenty escaped, but of theso 15 wore recaptured the same night. We trust that the details of this affair have been more than usually exaggerated. The tiUmdairl has an amusing account of the kea, a variety of green parrot in New Zealand, which has lately been placed under ban by the Legislature. Any- body is to have a shilling who kills a kea. It appears that the bird, which is naturally graminivorous, a few years ago, during a severe winter, found it impossible to procure food, and hannted the carcase butchers' sheds to eat bits of mutton. It approved the mutton, though mutton is not indigenous to New Zealand, while the kea is, and presently discovered, whether by inductive ratiocination or experience, that sheep were made of it. Ho it attacked the sheep. Flocks of keas visit the folds at night, settle en the sheep, whoee wool rives a bird a line purchase, and peck and peck till they reach the kidney fat, which they eat, while the poor sheep dies in agony. English dogs also, when thay take to sheep- eating, always gorge themselves with the kidney fat, often neglecting the flesh, and killing sheep after sheep for their dainty. The shepherds in New Zealand some- times lose a sheep a night, and the kea is declared to be as costly a pest as the rabbit. Miss Catherine Booth and Miss Charlestoorth were arrested on Monday afternoon by the police at Geneva on their returu from a Salvationist funeral at Chene Bougeries, near that city.

An Important Success in Oyster Culture.\u2014 Mr. Ryder, tlio Kinbryologist of the United States Fish Commission, has finally solved the problem of the culture of oysters from artificially impregnated eggs. On the 4th inst., at the (iovenunent station at Stockton, Maryland, there wore many millions of young oysters three-quarters uf an inch in diameter, which had been hatched from eggs artiflcially impregnated 46 days before. This fact is of the utmost importance to oyster culturists thiougliout the world, as from a single ovster several millions of eggs can be obtained by the planting of the artificially-reared spat; thus, oysters may be produced in practically un- limited quantities in any sheltered estuary in temperate climates, and localities in which oysters do not grow can, with great ease, be stocked by seed transplanted in bulk while very .small. Remarkable Marriage.\u2014A remarkable wed- ding took place on the stage of the Buckingham Theatre in Loiiisvillo last month, when Mr. John Zmaris, better known as .Major Mite, 30 years of age, ami 42 inches high, was solemnly married to Miss Marie Nail, aged 33, wlioMe height is only 31 inches. This pair of midgets, who have been travelling all over the world for several vears, fell in love with each other when on exhibition at Pittsburg three months ago, chiefly, it would seem, because they were both of a size, and it must be admitted the area of choice for such dwarfs is exceedingly limited, (to tlie occasion of this stage wedding a great crowd assembled in the theatre. At 9 o'clock the curtain was rolled up, disclosing a stage aet after the style of a fashionable drawing-room. A few momenta after oo'clock the manager's daughter came upon the stage with the licence, which she handed to Judge Hoke, who promptly performed the ceremony, and concluded it by kissing the bride. Then amid the wildest applause the curtain went down upon the fairy-like scene. Icebergs in the Atlantic. \u2014The steamship Hel- vetia has arrived at Montreal, from Antwerp, after a somewhat eventful passage. The Helvetia was com- manded by Captain .Smith, and left Antwerp oa the sth ult. Almost from the time of starting until the 11th the steamer encountered heavy gales, with high seas. On the 12th the weather moderated, when a somewhat thick fog hung over the water. The fog remained for a couple of days. On the morning of the 15th, the vessel was about 150 or 200 miles from the Straits of Belle Isle, when several icebergs came in view. Orders wexe at once given to shut off steam. The steamer then moved slowly, but in a short space of time it was found that she was completely surrounded by these floating moun- tains of ice. The utmost cantion had to be nsed to prevent the steamer being struck by some of the bergs, but finally the vessel was got clear of her dangerous com- panions and brought safely to her destination. Captain Smith said he thought it was the first time that icebergs in such numbers bail been met with so far from shore, and accounted for it by the prevalence of strong westerly winds. Captain Smith's arrival was looked for with much interest at Montreal, owing to the Ludwig being so long overdue. When spoken to about the missing steamer, Captain Smith's replies were anything but hopeful ones\u2014 indeed, it was inferred that he did not think the Ludwig or any of the 70 or 80 souls on board of her would ever reach their destination. Sparruics in Australia.\u2014A premium of 6d. per dozen has been placed upon sparrows' heads by the Government of South Australia, acting on the advice of a Commission specially appointed to inquire iuto the \"sparrow question,\" while the aomewhat dispropor- tionate snm of 2*. tW. per 100 is offered for the tiny pale blue eggs of the bird. The bird, which only a few years ago such efforts were made to acclimatise in Australia, and whose first arrival was hailed with greater enthusiasm than would uow be \"displayed on the arrival of a Bend Or, a duchtws, or a prize merino, is now doomed to exter- mination\u2014if that can possibly be achieved. So rapidly have the few pairs which were introduced a few years ago multiplied under the congenial skies and amid the luxuriant vegetation of the Australian colonies, where there are few or none of the checks on their increase which exist in the old country, that the agriculturists complain of the serious injury done by them to their wheat and fruit crops, and have called upon the Govern- ment to devise some means of insuring their destruction. The evidence given before the Commission appointed to inquire into the matter affords eloquent examples of the destructiveness of these hard-billed birds. One witness says that in the short space of ten days the sparrows took a tou and a half of grapes. They stripped all the figs off five trees, and kept low 15 acres of lucerne during summer. Another complains that in the season they took 3(M. worth of fruit; while a third declared that be sowed peas three times, and each time they were destroyed by sparrows. The fecundity of the sparrow in South Australia is described as astonishing. A few to-day are thousands next season. Its work is done on a scale disheartening to the cultivator, and nnder con- ditions he cannot control, for the seed is taken out of the ground, the fruit-bud off the tree, the sprouting vegetable as fast as it grows, and the fruit before it is ripe, and therefore before it can be housed and saved. Neither apricots, cherries, figs, apples, grapes, peaches, plums, pears, nectarines, loquats, olives, wheat, barley, peas, cabbages, cauliflowers, nor seeds nor fruit of any kind are spared by its omnivorous bill; and all means of defence tried against its depredations, whether scare- crows, traps, netting, shooting, or poisoning, are declared to be insufficient to cope with the enemy.\u2014Land.", "id_issue": "0000237_18830914", "id_newspaper": "0000237", "page": "0003", "title": "General News of the Week."}], "1929-03-06": [{"content": "Certain reductions in the French income tax are foreshadowed for the first time since the war. \u2022 * \u2022 \u2022 Rangoon Corporation have decided to accord a civic reception to-morrow to Mahatma Gandhi on his arrival rroni Calcutta. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Dr. F.

Additions to the Empire.\u2014The Union Jack has been hoisted by a party from Her Majesty's ship Wallaro on the Russell, Bellona, and Stuart Islands of the Solomon group. The Solomon Islands constitute the largest group in the Pacific. They extend over 600 miles of sea, and seven of them are from 50 to 100 miles long and 15 to 30 miles wide. Their interior is very mountaiuotis, one volcano reaching an altitude of 8,000 feet. The coasts of the islands are much indented, and afford capital harbours. The inhabitants are intelligent and clever, but for many years traders could do nothing with them owing to their cruel and treacherous disposition. For the past 40 years, however, missions have been estab- lished in the islands with good results. r\u00a3 0V , X ' 8 YoONQ Dream. \u2014 A case of love under a \u2022 m 3 \u2022 *2?iust beeu investigated at Dunstable.

They tramped towards London, and on Friday evening were observed to pass through Dunstable, the girl being apparently greatly exhausted. About five o'clock next morning her father and his head clerk arrived in that town and made enquiries to the police. A constable was despatched in the direction taken by the fugitives, and he found them sleeping by the roadside. No other accommodation has the girl enjoyed since she left her father's roof.

Egypt and the Soudan.\u2014A convention between England and Turkey respecting tbe affaire of Egypt was signed at tbe Porte on Monday. There are (says tbe Pall Mall Gazette) various versions of its details In the columns of our contemporaries. Putttng all tbt details together, it is possible to arrive at a pretty accu- rate ideaaa to the result of Sir Heflry Drummond Wolff 1 prolonged negotiations with the Sultan. The corres- pondent of the Timet at Constantinople says\" Tbe convention, as a whole, is based on recognition of and respect for the rights of the Sultan As Suzerain of Egypt; and provides for tbe acceptance of thia broad prindple by all the Powers interested. From what can be gathered at tbis early moment, tbe public impression is favourable, and I have heard intelligent Turks say, ' We bare come out of tbis question very cheaply, and must admit that England has not dealt with it in any but her unially friendly spirit towards us.' It remains now to be seftn $ higher Powers will look upon tbe matter in the same light.\" The convention consists of a number of articles, protocols, and notes. Tbe first article declares that the firmans and existing treaties regarding Egypt aris to be maintained, extept as modified by the new convention. Tbe second defines the territorial limitations of Egypt. Tbe third declares that tbe neutralization and free passage of tbe Suez c&nal, in time of peace and in time of war, is recognized. The fourth declares that tbe English troops will evacuate Egypt withlh three yo*re from the signature, provided that there is no risk or danger to the security of Egypt in so doing. After the three years England is to have the superintendence of tbe Egyptian army and military arrangements during a further period of two years. Tbere is nothing in th# convention to prevent tbe Khedive from retaining th\u00ab British officers now serving with it, or from engaging others. The fifth provides tbat all the Powers will be requested to give their adhesion to all the principles Of an international character adopted in this convention, and to sign an Act guaranteeing an inviolability of Egyptian territory, except in case of disorders, or of danger of foreign intervention after tbe evacuation, in which case English and Turkish troops alone wil| have the right to intervene, jointly or separately. Tbe sixth provides various modifications to be Introduced into tbe capitulations, tbe principal one giving criminal jurisdiction to the reformed courts. It is not proposed to abolish the capitulations absolutely, but tbere is an understanding that tbe international tribunals shall have extended authority in criminal cases. This article further deals with the tribunals, the press, and matters of quarantine. The seventh relates to tbe date of the ratification. Outside the convention there will be a supplementary document by Which the European Powers will be invited to inquire into tbe desirability, of intro- ducing an equilibrium into the receipts and expenditure of Egypt, and of adopting measures to facilitate audi equilibrium. \"I am assured,\" says the Daily Newt correspondent, \"on tbe highest authority that no reference has been or will be made tb loans or the Egyptian finances, though tbe tribute will probably remain, as at present, a first charge on the revenue.'* Regarding this last point tbe Standard correspondent says :\u2014\"lt is in one of these protocols that the Egyptian tribute is formally recognized as the first charge on tbe whole revenues.\" _ In diplomatic circles at Cairo it is belisved that England and Turkey will propose a European Conference to settle tbe modifications of the capitulation and other reforms under the new convention. The Time* Cairo correspondent telegraphing on Wed-' nesday, says :\u2014The latest version of the new convention asserts tbat the withdrawal of our troops will be effected in three years provided that there is no disturbance, and tbat the British officers are to retire from tbe Egyptian' army two years later.

Jules Gravy) sent for M.de Freydnet, who expressed bis willingness to form a Cabiuet. His friends, it appears, made tbe retirement of General Boulanger a condition of their acceptance of office, so on Friday M. de Freycinet again waited on tbe President and informed him tbat he could not carry 6at bis intention. M. Gravy then summoned M. Rouvier,' chairman of tbe Budget Committee, but, after making inquiries, be, while declining for himself the task of forming a Cabinet, consented to endeavour to discover tbe elements for a Ministerial combination. He was of opinion tbat it would be possible to constitute a Cabinet by the concentra- tion of tbe forces of the Republican party, under the direction of a politician wbo had already held tbe Presidency of a Ministry of thts character. M. Clthnenceau had expressed his readiness to take office himself as President of the Cabinet, but would not support any other leader. M. Floquet was on Monday sent for. On his declining to form a Cabinet, M. Grevy asked him to exert pressnre once more on M. de Frev-' cinet. \u00bbi. Floquet consented, but on going home and reflecting he wrote to say that he did not think be could do so. M. Grtvy then saw M. Duclerc, but both speedily saw that the interview would come to nothing. The President next consulted M. Ferry, who advised him to summon M. Cldmenceau. \"If he has no majority,\" he said, \" I am sure he is straigMforward enough to abandon all obstruction, as soon as he sees that he is in a minority.\" On Tuesday M. Floquet was again sent for by M. and upon being asked to form a Ministry said be would take a day before giving his reply. M. Floquet, being unable to come to an agreement with the Opportunist leaders. Informed President Gr<svy on Wed- nesday afternoon tbat he declined to ondertake tho for- mation of a new Ministry.

Burmah. \u2014The Limbin Prince hM surren- dered. This is regarded as an event of considerable importance. He was (says the Timet Rangoon corres- pondent) the last legitimate Alaungpra Prince in tbe field agsinst us, and with his submission tbe confederacy of southern Sban chiefs formed to support him is broken up. There is every reason to believe that all tbe Bhan Chiefs \u00abriU now submit without further trouble. Tbe Shan States were tbe only districts remaining in Upper Burmah where there was reason to fear any attempt at organized resistance. Of ttie 2000 volunteers required from tbe native army for tbe Burmeee police, 1200 are already enrolled\u2014 namely, 600 from Bengal, 450 from Bombay, and 150 from Madras. Tbey will be seat to Bnrinah in tbe course of tbis month. Canada. \u2014Mr. O'Brien's campaign against the Marquis of Lsnsdowne, Governor-General of Canada, has fallen fiat, and happily has not been attended with tbe violent scenes that had been anticipated. While at Toronto on tbe 18th Mr. O'Brien was mobbed, and It is said he is still suffering from tbe effects of a blow from a stone. He has, however, caught a severe cold, and his physician warned him against farther exertion. Mr. O'Brien nevertheless determined on Monday to go to Hamilton to apeak, and then return to Montreal. On Monday Mr. O'Brien spoke briefly at Hamilton, Ontario, to an audience of about 2000 in the Palace Rink. After the meeting he left the rink by a back way, and got into a cab to return to his hotel. During the joarney revolver shots were exchanged between the occupants of a carriage supposed to be supporters of Mr. O'Brien and the crowd. The O'Brien party, however, emphatically deny that they fired upon the mob. The crowd followed Mr. O'Brien's party and pelted them with bad eggs on their entering the hotel. The mob remained In tbe street cheering and hoptlng nntil driven oft by the police. Mr O'Brien, who is said to be much fatigued and weak, has closed his tour In Ontario, and has returned to Niagara for rest. He was to visit Montreal yesterday and Boston on Sunday. It is said Mr. O'Brien left for Niagara, saying that he was determined not to spend the Queen's birthday on British soil! The Ustted States. \u2014Queen Kapiolani, Princess Liliuokalani, and their suite left on the Anchor Line steamer City of Rome for Europe on Wednesday.

The Virginia Legislature has passed a resolution cow demning tbe Irish Crimes Bill, and subsequently ad- journed tine die. Tbe 58th anniversary of the Brooklyn (New York) Sunday School Union was Celebrated there on Wednesday. Eighty thousand children paraded through tbe streets under the direction of Mr. James S. Caso, grand marshal, tbe girls all wearing white dresses and carrying silk banners. Three cases of yellow fever are reported from Key West, two of which proved fatal. A great fire is reported from Lake Linden, a town in causing tbe destruction of over 200 buildings. Tbe loss is estimated at 300,000/. In a fog off tbe coast of the United agates on tbe 19th inst, two steamships of the White Star Line, the Celtic and the Britannic, <&rae into collision. A hole was torn in the latter vessel below ths water line, and six steerage passengers were killed. Both vessels are now in New York Harbour. Father McGlynn, who has been ordered, on pain of excommunication, to appear before tbe POpe to answer certain allegations against his conduct in reference to socialistic agitation, spoke at the Cooper Institute, New YoVk, at a Knights of Labour meeting. A protest was made against tbe ratifying by the United States Senate of tbe proposed extradition treaty with Russia. Father MoGlynn, who was the chief speaker, said that among other things it was always customary in drawing extra- dition treaties to exclude political offences from ex- traditable Crimes, adding;\u2014\"l don't stand here to justify the assassination of tbe Czar ; but if I read in the morning papers that the Czar had been killed, I would not put crape upon my bat. lam here to do honour to the man who feels it bis duty to kill the Czar. There are noble, heroic, pure-spirited, and self-denying men who desire the killing of the Czar, aud who have felt that tbey were doing the noblest thing for their country in trying to kill the Czar.\" Mr. Victor Drury, an Inter- nationalist, spoke, saying that no Nihilist or revolutionist couid have desired anything more radical to be spoken than that which had been said by Dr. McGlynn. A letter was read from Stepniak, in London, expressing surprise that America could make supb a treaty with Russia. New Planet. \u2014Dr. Palisa, of Vienna, an- nounces the discovery of a new minor planet (No. 266), at midnight ot tbe 18th inst., RA. 16b. 13m.155., North Polar dtstance 10if 8' 22\". The new body is of the 12th magnitude. The Debt of Russia.\u2014A Foreign-office report states that the total inscribed and non-inscribed debt of Rusciaon January 1,1884, was set down at 334,973,639/., in addition to loans advanced by tbe Treasury to rail- way and other companies, making the total liability 4W8,777(035/. On January 1, 1886. the total indebted- ness was 446,745.367/. On January 1,1886, 518,619,419/. Jt is clear from these figures (Sir R.

The whole island quaked. Every volcano was soon in action, and scalding lava ran down the mountain sides, buried villages, and heaped up fantastically in the ocean tide. NearLy every Tillage on the island was destroyed, and between 175,000 and 200,000 people were killed. One gfeat island of the Javanese group, Krakatoa, sank in the sea. In another place sixteen volcanic peaks emerged. It is characteristic of the most destructive earthquakes that they occur near the sea, so that their horrors are followed by great tidal waves that double the number of killed. This was the case in the historic earth- quake of Lisbon in 1755. Once before, in 1531, the city had been destroyed, and from time to time minor shocks were fe)t. It was on All, Saints' Day, 1755, that the last terrible shiok occtirred. This earth- quake involved 7,500,000 square miles of territory, and the shock was felt as far north as Finland, a.nd extended to the St Lawrence in Canada. Immediately follow- ing the disaster a fire began in the wrecks that escaped the terrible tidal waves, and the scum of Portugal and Southern Europe flocked there to rob the dead and the wounded. So recently as October 30, 1900, a severe earthquake occurred in Venezuela. The President became so excited that he leaped from the second floor of the Government House and broke his. leg. In July also of 1900 there was a severe earthquake in the territory of Kars, wiping out firo villages. This seems somewhat similar to the recent one in Russia. Earlier in the same year an earthquake visited Tiflis, completely destroy- ing thirteen villages. Eight or nine hun- dred people lost their lives in this calamity. After this our local earthquakes\u2014the shocks of th,is year and last at Inverness, the Bridge of Allan, and Dunblane shocks of 1900, and the ever-recurring sensations at Crieff pale into insignifiance. Gentlewomen in \"Service.\" That there is scope for the work of educated women in domestic service there is no doubt, for many of those who have tried it are proofs of the healthfulness and even pleasantness of the life. Several girls, trained as technical teachers, have found that work too hard, and so have taken situations as \" lady serve.nts,\" and find their present positions suit them far better, and thev positively enjoy the work, while the certificates they hold enable them to command good salaries. In order to band together gentlew6inen willing to engage in this work there is the \"Guild of Dames of the Household\" (president, Miss Nixon, \"Mona,\" Tivoli, Cheltenham, who will be glad to hear from ladies willing to be trained), which pro- vides training for gentlewomen between twenty and thirty-five years of age. It. is through the kindness of ladies who have large staffs of servants that this training ii ob- tained, and cooks also attend cookery classes. The tilue taken is from one to five \"weeks or longer. No charge is made for rooms or training, but 10s per week is the cost of full board, or single meals are provided at a very reasonable rate. The \" dames\"' are also put in communication with mistresses requiring their services, and Miss Nixon says that the demand for such is far greater than the sup- ply. Cape are not always worn, but 60nie wear a very becoming one with a band Of willow-pattern sateen supplied by the Guild. Badges are always used. Mistresses are re- quired to provide separate bedrooms, give a fair amount of leisure time, and from JilB to \u00a330 per annum.\u2014The Girls' Own Paper.

Charles Simeon. In Holy Trinity Simeon was vicar for fifty- ft>ur years' And the pulpit there must be regarded as the one associated with his name. It was an old two-decker. He preached in it from 1782 to 1833. It was taken down, and has been so redticed it has been fashioned into a chiffonier. It sta.mls in tho vestry, with a brass plate thefeon telling of its for- mer glory. The one now standing in its place was only put up two years before Simeon's death, and I was fortunate enough to meet with one, a former churchwarden, who had heard him preach from the old structure. I must say that the present pulpit strikes one as unique, but when one learns that it is chiefly of composition, and that the steps are only of iron, some of the charm is destroyed. The vicar confessed that the pulpit is a little difficult of ascent. I expect the venerable Simeon, when ho preached in it in the latter part of his life, was not so comfortable as in the old two-decker. Henry Martyn was curate to Simeon, and often preached in this church. Sir James Stephen said of him\u2014\" Martyn is the one heroic name which adorns the annals of the English phurch from tho days of Queen Elizabeth to our own.\" The son of one who had been a Cornish miner, Martyn struggled until he occupied the proud summit of Uni- versity ambition as Senior Wrangler. \"When this man, whom his fellow-students knew as \"the man who had not lost an hour,\" gained his high position, he confessed that he was surprised to find ho \" had only grasped a shadow.\" Intent on taking up the law as an avocation, his energies were turned into the missionary field by the Rev. Charles Simoon. It was to this church that Marsden also, who was the apostle of New Zealand, often came, when a student at St John's College, to listen to Simeon. By the recommendation given by Simeon of the young graduate to Mr Wilberforce (writes Mr Fred Hastings in the Sunday at Home), Marsden was sent out to New South Wales as a chaplain, and did a mighty mission work there and in New Zea- land. I could find no tablet here to his memory, although one might fitly find its place near to that of Martyn.

Professor W. Hellpach, of Karlsruhe, has published the results of the first all-round inquiry ever made into the problem\u2014\" How- far are the brain and temperament of man dependent upon natural surroundings?\" His report is entitled \" The Geopsychic Phenomena,\" and has made a great stir in German scientific circles, owing to the bold theses of the Professor, who depicts humanity as a mere vitalised barometer, which reacts incessantly to the stimulus of external forces, but has little independent control over its own movements. Landscape, says Hellpach, has infinitely greater importance than climate in forming national character. The idea that climate is more important is a delusion. \"In the United States, the fantastic mountain world of the Great West will in time create a different and much more imaginative race than that which exists in the level east and south \"At present America's population is too much in a state of flux to allow of this differ- ence being determined, but the change is going on.\" America will thus in the future have two populations of entirely different psychical inclinations and characteristics. Professor Hellpach gives a whole series of facts to show man in his capacity as barome- ter. His activities depend upon weather fluctuations. There live peculiarly sensitive \" wettermenschen \" (weathermen) whose whole nervous system is affected by thunder- storms. On these tea, coffee, and tobacco taken during a thunderstorm act with extraordi- nary force, and the most moderate dose of alcohol, which in clear weather would have no effect, produces violent agitation, and even temporary paralysis. The Snow Man. A second type of weatherman is the snow man, well known to nerve specialists. Shortly before a snowfall their eating, feeding, and sleeping are entirely deranged; and they are thus able to predict a snowfall more surely than can a meteorologist with all his instru- ments. \" Snow men\" are rarer than \" thunder- storm men.\" Both quickly recover from the weather effects, and even feel better than they did before. In addition to weather, man reacts to an enormous number of external stimuli, some of which are far off, intangible, and even concealed from the senses. Light has pre- cisely the same attractive effect on men as it has on insects. The word \" moonstruck\" is not a figure of speech, but a reality. Moon- light has a marked effect upon sleepers, and is the main cause of somnambulism. The changes of the moon produce precise organic effects upon certain lower animals, and man is also liable to be moonstruck. Water, though at a distance and invisible, affects the nervous system and makes some men conscious of its effects. Hence t.he \" divining rod \" is a reality. The under- ground water really does cause nervous twitchings of the water-seeker's hands, and this sets the rod oscillating. In the same way diviners of hidden coal, ore, and other i mineral treasures are quite honest. \"It is established that there exist sensi- tive men whose psychical condition is affected by the composition of the soil under- : neath, though of this composition thoy have t no knowledge.\" And even astrology hai a basis of truth. The changes of the earth in its relation to the constellations involve . changes of gravitation \" which cause nervous ( disturbances, and thus operate on the brain.\" In a scientific sense no man is, therefore, independent of the stars and [ planets. Climatic Influences on Man. Dr Hellpach deals in a novel way with \u2022 climatic influences on man. He shows that heat and cold are not half so important as moisture and dryness. These cause real phy sical changes, because in dry districts the blood is poorer in water; hence there is in- creased activity, a tendency to sleeplessness, and to an increased circulation of the blood. A maritime climate affects men from inland \u25a0 more than a Continental climate affects an i islander. High altitudes tend to make : plain-dwellers fearful, whereas low altitudes merely mako mountaineers homesick. Women acclimatise better than m\u00abn, and dark races ' better than blond. For the very blond races there is no real acclimatisation; it is impos- sible for them to live in tropical climates for long periods without a break except at the ' cost of mental decay. Seasonal changes, says Hellpach, are as im- portant a-s climatic changes. Men sleep best under the greatest air pressure and greatest atmospheric electricity. Work is worse at the point where the heat curve reaches its point. It is a mistake to regard . winter as a time of decay and death. Atten- . itiveness and memory are strongest from OtAo- -5 ber to January and lowest in summer; the . | muscles are strongest in late autumn and .! early winter: and the highest suicide and in- -1! sanity rate is reached everywhere in May and \u25a0 June, despite favourable weather conditions ) and the diminution of the hardships of , poverty and unemployment. t Hellpach, however, shows that there are re- curring periods within the human body and mind which modify seasonal changes. .Th\u00aelives of Goethe and other great men indicate that every seven years the individual's desire for the love and affection of the opposite sex rises, and then declines until another seven years has passed. Children and Falling Snow. i Going deeper into the effects of landscape 'on the character, actions, and temperament of men, the Professor says the greatest sensi-| bility to landscape is felt on the verge of man- hood : after thirty it often vanishes entirely, i Landscapes work on the nervous system both by their colouring and by their outlines and forms. A red and yellow sunset has marked disquieting influence. Th\u00a9 wonderful red sunsets which followed! the Krakatoa eruption in 1883 had a violently exciting effect on the brains of mankind Certain forms of disease foster a craze for red. This is so with epileptics and hysteria sufferers. Medical reports show that men with limbs contorted by tuberculosis some- times have a craze for wearing bright, red nether garments, although this would have the effect of calling public attention to their infirmity. Blue skies and green fields operate soothingly; but black, grey, and white in Nature depress, and produce semi-paralytic effects. The shimmer on water at first works agreeably, but tends later to exhaust. Landscapes in which horizontal planes pro- dominate have an \"indifferent\" effect. The \" discovery of the flat\" in modern paintinjr is due to the fact that level plains, \"thanks !to their ' landscapic indifference,' harmonise well with the different moods of those who see them.\" Great upright lines and high masses operate in the direction of paralysis on the mind. That is the reason almost all uneducated people regard Gothic architecture as awesome and impressive. The complexities of a mountainous land- scape have at first an irritating effect upon unaccustomed people who gaze on them for Ions?. On the other hand, movement in a landscape tranquillises and fixed the attention. Thi< explains why children who cannot con- centrate their attention on a fixed object will stand for half an hour watching the falling of snow.", "id_issue": "0000164_19120401", "id_newspaper": "0000164", "page": "0004", "title": "MAN A VITALISED WEATHER-GLASS."}], "1928-11-09": [{"content": "SICILIAN TOWN BURTED BY LAYA. 20,000 PEOPLE IN PERIL.

Hope is still entertained that part of Mascali may be spared, as the stream of lava has been deflected into the bed of the Soxrangnaro torrent, where it is flowing down into the sea. The la\\;i stream at its widest part extended over 2.000 feet, and covered a stretch of ten miles long from the first crater that burst into oruption. An iron bridge was twisted and fused by tho heat, and trees have been consumed while the lava was still 15 feet away. IMMINENT DISASTER The large town of Giarre. which has over 20,000 inhabitants, is now seriously threatened by another stream. If the Java readies it it will be a very serious disaster. All Italian steamers plying to and from Messina have been ordered to put into Catania, and thus partly rcplacc the interrupted train service. Scismological exports state that the present eruption of Mount Etna is unprecedented both as regards its violence and the quantity of matter erupted, amounting to thousands of tons. Experts believe that it is likely to continue for some time. KRAKATOA ALSO, 100 EXPLOSIONS AND 20 WATERSPOUTS. At tho same time the East Indian island volcano of Krakatoa has showed renewed activity. Since Sunday 112 distinct explosions have been noticed. Eruptions beneath the sea caused the water to be thrown up 20 times says Reutcr's cablc from Batavia, Java. Note.\u2014Krakatoa has been very frequently, if not continuously, in active eruption for a good many months past. But, in contrast to the great explosion of this volcano in 1883. little or no damage or loss of life has been reported. In 1883 the island volcano cave rise to a gigantic tidal wave that caused the death of 20,000 people, while two'thirds of the island itself was completely blown away. C louds of dust on that, occasion drifted as far as Europe, and tho tidal wave was felt even in the English Channel.", "id_issue": "0000407_19281109", "id_newspaper": "0000407", "page": "0016", "title": "TERROR OF ETNA."}], "1913-12-12": [{"content": "SHIELD AGAIN WON BY POOLE. IMPORTANT PROPOSALS. Tbe annual meeting of representatives of Clubs in the Dorset Stifle Club League was held ac Erming. ton, the resiuence of Mr. C. S. Prideaux, Dorchester. Lord Digby, president, was iv tbe chair, and there were also preaont :\u2014Messrs. W. G. Granger, G. J. Pitt, and J. Whitelock, Poole ; Messrs. Cressy and Adams, Sturminscar Newton ; Messrs. F. W.

Marrabie, Dorchester, hoa secretary ; and C. S. Prideaux, Dorchester, assistant hen. secretary. The fourth annual report was presented by Mr. Marrabie. Tbere were, he said, no funds in hand to provide souvenirs for the team winning Lord Digby's shield. Only seven Clubs joined the League end entered for the Competitions, so that with an additional Ids subscribed by five Clubs the receipts had amounted to i\"- The expenses had been kept down to the lowest possible limit, yet there \u2022\u2022< .s an adverse balance of 4s \"d. It was a great pity that tooro Clubs ban not joined the League during the past year, ap as to provide a fqnd for tho giving of souvenirs to the members of the winning leuni, and other prices if funds allowed- \u25a0 The Clubs competing this year for Lord Digby's shield wero only seven, naiuolv, Stalbridge, Dor- cbebter, Biuuksome. B'idport, Cosens & Co., Stur- minster Newton, and Borough of Poole, and Poole were again tho winners with 10 points, making the | high total average of 1.132 1, equal to an averago of 18873 for each sboot out of a possible 200. C'osens & Cq.'s Club show a still higher averago, but unfortun- ately for them they sent in no ret-arn? for two of the rounds, .->o that they lost points. The total averages abpw that the system of deciding the winners by points on the League system does not altogether workout quite satisfactorily, Dorchestor Club, for instance, coming equal throe by points, but only five by averages. The system of handicaps by membership of Clubs did nos seem to work very well. The only Club it affected waa Dorchester, and it became a question whether so cue better scheme could not ba devised wnich weuld induce the smaller Clubs, in the county to joiu the League cad enter tbe competitions with some fair ohance of success. He was also 91\" opinion that the rapid stage of tbe competition for tbe shield should be eliminated, as it was impossible to be certain that all teams interpreted tbe couditiens for rupid shooting in exactly the same way, and unless this was done any , team giving a freer interpretation to the rules than j : another, or being a little lax in the matter of exact | time, must have a great advantage over another team , that read the rule more strictly. j Ie was impossible to have one umpire to attend all ! competit ons, and unless that was done he did not j sac how they could make sure of each Club's team 1 shooting rapid under identically the same conditions, and it might b\u00ab much better 60 eliminate this stage | altogether, aud if thought advisable to have an increased nuraba' of rounds in the deliberate stage. The report and a statement of the accounts yera : adopted. Mr. Perry meved.and CaptainDawson seconded that rapid shooting b9 done away with. Mr. Pitt, while he disagreed with rapid shooting in the League, for reasons ttiat tbe Hon. Secretary had so nicely stated, thought that figure shooting was very desirable. Bull's eye shooting was likely to become monotonous, and was not calculated to popularise the League. It was eventually resolved that the rapid stage be eliminated, that the deliberate tiring be continued,and tbat ten rouuds be provided for figure targets. Mr. Marrabie thought that a subscription of 5s witb only seven Clubs iv the League was insufficient. Ha proposed that it be increa\u00abed,an 1 it was resolved tbat the subscription of each Club be 7s 6d. On Mr. Marrable's proposition it waa resolved tbat there be five shoots in tha cemingyear in tbe months ot April, May, and June, and that tbe scores be> counted, all against ail, points to bs given to leading Cio-bs against ail others. The Lord Digby Challenge Shield was formally awarded to Poole, and Lord Digby congraiuiated the Club on tbe mem bars' signal success. Mr. Pitt thanked the President for tbe com- pliment. The Po ile Club was only a small one, and there had been great difficulty in maintaining member- ship. They had only 12 msmbera, but they were honest, straight-forward snooting man, and tbey had \" hung on \" to that shield for all they were worth. (Applause.) He hoped that arrangements might be made by whicb one Club could see another shoot. After a discussion on Mr. Pitt's proposal it was resolved that Clubs be asked to voluntarily send representatives to watch tbe shooting of competing ciubs. Lord Digby was re-elected president with aoDlama- tion, and Mr. Marrabie's and Mr. Pndeaux'a re- elections wore equally cordial. Arising out of a general discussion it was resolved tbat a guarantee should be given that in future mementoes not to exceed in cost 3s each should be pro- vided for members of tbe team winning the challenge shield. MID-WESSEX RAINFALL ASSOCIATION NOVEMBER, 1913.' On the whole the mildest November for at least 17 years, aud like October unu ualJy equable. Tha November of 1899, and in a less degree those of 1898 I and 1908, bad higher extreme temperatures, but also lower ones. This November bad no extreme warmth, but aiso a consistent absence of cold. Tbe average temperatures were very high ;and at this station tne coldest day. 23rd bad a maximum of 495 degrees and tha shade minimum went no lower than 31 degrees. There Was practically no frost, save a thick white frost that one morning, aud summer flowers were blooming happily when December began. The wind average was high, but there was no serious gale, though some oi the observers mention . a strong squall on tho 11th. Cloud was rather below normal, though the rain- fall was well above the average \u2014hero by per cent., and the numner of rain-days was very high, except 111 the extreme S. ana tt. VV. of our area, and the air excessively humid. The greater part of the rain fell in considerable amounts from the 9th to tbe 15tb ; and also on the 21st, 011 whicb day a general rain of some importance varying but little in quantity, fell ever our wh<;lo region. On tbe 11th tharo were storms of great intensity localiv, with thunder and lightning and hail at many stations, notably at Chard about 5.30 p.m., and at Whitelackiugtou iv tbe amali hours of tha following morning.

The very cloudy weather truly prevented their baing seen to advantage. Nevertheless tbe marked prolongation of light long after sunset on 26tb, 27th, and 28th, and the brilliant red glow in the W., at times discernible through the clouds, was enough to prepare any watchful person for the marvellous beauty of tbe one really clear cloudieas evening\u2014tbe29\u00bbh\u2014when, half-an-hour or more after sundown, the hills facing west were glowing as if witb sunshine, and the glory ef tbe sky, deepening from gold to apricot and to orimson, delayed the uightfall for fully an hour and a half !

Previous accounts sent, which were derived from Annanvite sources, claimed the victory for the Black Flags. The following is a correct account: \u2014On the Ist of September the French advanced within 12 miles of Hontay, to a\" village called Pallan. Tliere they found the enemy in casemated forts, on which the gunboats had no effect. After three days' hard fight- ing the works were carried at the point of the bayonet.

The losses of the lilack Flags were over 500 killed. The French captured two guns, two standards, and one chief's l>attle flag. General Bouet retired to Hanoi to await reinforcements, leaving 300 men to hold the cap- lured towns.\" Paris, Sept. 15.\u2014The official report of General l'ouut, received by the Minister of Marine, supplies the following fresh details of the recent fighting near Hontay: The losses of tlio enemy are estimated at 1000. Two Hags and a quantity of arms were taken. The French liold the positions captured. The losses of the French were two officers and 14 men killed, and three officers Mid 35 men wounded. The enemy's position was HHsaulted at the point of the bayonet, the troops being in the water up to their breasts. The strength of the enemy was 4000. The enemy expected reinforcements from Sontay, but the French gunboats prevented them liom arriving. The Minister of Marine has received a telegram announcing that five companies of French troops, aided l y the Yellow Hags and three companies of Annamitc troops, carried the fortified position of Pay on the Ist inst., and on the 3d inst. established a fortified post at Palan. In the lighting dur'ng these operations the French lost 54 killed and wounded and the enemy lt'Ot). Paris, Sept. 10.\u2014The Minister for the Navy has received the following official despatch from Hanoi, under date the 14th in\u00ae?. :\u2014\" After the affair of the 15th of August, and notwithstanding the inundation, five com- panies of Marines, three of Annamite riflemen, a batiery, and two gunboats ascended the lied Biver towards fSc.ng Tai, under the command of General Bouet. The right w ing was supported by a body of Yellow Flag auxiliaries. I>n the Ist of .September the fortified position of Day \u00ab\\as attacked and taken. After a severe struggle a tayonet charge was necessary. Our troops were up to Iheir chests in water, but showed remarkable >'lan. The enemy, numbering 4000, were everywhere dispersed, hnd the tire of our gunboats greatly retarded the arrival of their reinforcements from Song Tai. On the 3d inst. we established a fortified position at T'alan, at the spot where the Day joins the main stream. The enemy's losses are 1000 men. Three flags and a quantity of arms were captured, and the hostile positions are retained by onr troops. Uur losses were two officers and 14 men killed, and three officers and 35 men wounded, 20 of them slightly. Cur auxiliaries suffered proportionately. ' The French Ambassador and Chinese Minister bad two interviews with Lord Granville at Walmtr Castle last week, and at the second interview they met This is an indication of the fact that the Foreign Secretary has been using his good ofiices, and to gooii j.urpu-e, in the very delicate and perplexing questions at issue between Pekin and Tai is. That Lord Granville's friendly influence has been feit and appreciated in Tar is is suf- ficiently manifest from the cordial expressions < f the French Prime Minister in his conversation with the cor- respondent of the Daily News. That the English Minister's services have been received in the spirit in which they were offered is in itself a good omen. It would be unwarrantable to despair of a frit ndly settle- ment of the Franco-Chinese dispute, now that the two Envoys have discussed the question together, in presence of a third Minister, in whose friendliness, good sense, and impartiality, they both have entire confidence Hongkong, Sept. 17 (New York Herald). \u2014General Bouet arrived here to-day from Tonquin, accompanied by M. llarmand, the French Commissioner. His position has been assumed by Colonel Bichut, Colonel Baden's Chief of Staff. Haiphong is said to be General lionet's place of assignment, though it has been assumed that he has been in reality removed from active command by the Commissioner-General. The conflict between the civil and military powers is daily assuming greater proportions. The Black Hags are resuming positions now within live miles of the citadel of Hanoi. At Palan, the fortified place which General Bouet succeeded in taking recently after stubborn resistance, the French have a small force of 120 men and two gunboats, iu which they can retire if necessary. Their position, however, is very critical. The Black Flags swarm upon the French outposts, which will soon have to be withdrawn until reinforcements arrive. The river traffic is almost entirely stopjted by pirates. Paris, Sept. 17.\u2014The Marquis Tseng arrived in Paris this evening. The contract announced a short time ago for the construction by an English firm of several river gunboats for the French Government, the Havas Agency states, \"will not be made, it having been impossible to close the bargain.\" M. Jules Ferry had an inter view to-day of an hour and a half's duration with M. Waddington, who it axe an account of his conversation at IVaimer Castle with Lord Uranville and the Marquis Tseng. The Lilfrte, the organ of the Pereires, while expressing doubts whether the absence of M. Challemel-Lacour at this moment can be attributable to indisposition, says :\u2014\" We bail the choice of M. Jules Ferry to replace him as a proof of the pacific spirit in which our diplomatic action with China will be conducted. We believe, despite all the rumours to the contrary that are circulated, that the President of the Council is thoroughly convinced of the considerable danger we should run, not only in regard to onr policy in the extreme East, but in our relations with Europe by a war with China. Although we have often differed with him on the subject of the system of colonial extension in which we see many perils without compensation, we entertain a efficiently high opinion of his patriotism not to suspect him of being capable, with a light heart, of plunging us into adventures the gravity and consequences of which are immeasurable. We are therefore convinced that M. Ferry will do everything hononrably possible to terminate this unfortunate affair pacifically. He is now beyond all doubt aided by the good wishes and assistance of England. The rapid journeys of M. Waddington between London and Parle attest the activity of the relations between the two Cabinets. China, too, seems more conciliatory, if M. Ferry can happily terminate this long and delicate negotiation, and relieve us from the embarrassment caused by the Tonquin expedition, and re-establish at once good relations with China and friendship with Eng- land, he will have accomplished a work for which the country will feel grateful, and will strengthen bis posi- tion in the Chambers. Madagascar.\u2014The ultimatum submitted by Admiral Pierre to the new Queen of Madagascar, liana- valona 111., lias been shown to the correspondent of the Daily Ne\\ ct, now at Antananarivo. It 1b of the most peremptory character. The French Republic demands that the Queen shall recognise its sovereignty over all districts ceded to it by the Sakalavas, which cover a sixth of the island and have a coast-line of 240 miles; that the laws prohibiting French purchases in Mada- gascar shall be repealed; and that the Queen shall, within 15 days, send a Plenipotentiary to such place as the Commissary df the Republic shall appoint, with powers \"to make any alterations in the Treaty of 18t>8 that the Commissary may propose to him.\" Moreover, the Malagasy Government shall, within 30 days, pay an indemnity to the Republic of 40,000;. The Prime Minister, who is just now Mayor of the Palace, and mar- rits each successive Queen, has replied that Madagascar will not negotiate at all, uuless the sovereignty of the Queen is recognised over the whole island. The French, therefore, occupy Tamatave, and the Hovas besiege them, and that will last until the Ministry at War can spare troops for an advance upon the capital. Calcutta, Sept. 18 (Timet).\u2014Startling news from Taiuatave reaches me. On good authority, lam assured that the published story of outrages falls far short of the truth. When Consul Pakenham was dying French priests strove to force their faith on him, and compelled him to kiss the crucifix. My informant declares that Admiral Pierre was in a mental condition which rendered him an irresponsible agent. These facts have been, I believe, communicated to the home authorities.

' The Sorth German Gazette, which recently created a '' scare \" by a solemn admonitiou to France, now adroitly turns round and warns the Times that it will not succeed in stirring up bad feeling between Paris and Berlin. The Gazette innocently disclaims the \"attitude of menace\" whioh the Time* had attributed to it, and suggests that the calculations of the English journal may perhaps be upset by a Franco-German ' 4 understanding.\" Germans \"wish France every success in the world,\" says the jdwtte, if \"she will take her stand on existing treaties.' Holland.\u2014The Hague, Sept. 17. \u2014The States-General were opened to-day by the King, who in bis speech from the Throne stated that the relations of Holland with foreign States were very friendly. Alluding to the war in Atchin, his said that serious efforts were still required to effect the complete pacification of i.he country, and eulogized the military forces for the gallant manner in which they were doing their duty. Revolts had been repressed at other points of the Dutch East Indies. Those colonies had sustained several calamities, the last being the unpreoedentedly disastrous uption of Krakatoa.

Cotenso has sent the following account which he has just received from Bishopstowe, Natal, of the attack made by Usibepu upon CeCewayo : \u2014\" Kukula, who reached Bishopstowe in the evening of August 6, states I am sent by Shingana, Mabanana, Qetuka, Sigananda, and Melelesi, by the order of Cetewayo, to say that he is alive, and that he asks that this matter may be inquired into, since this destruction has come upon him in his own home, in consequence of his \" sitting still\" according to his promise. 1 have not seen the King myself ; he was in the Bush country, near Ulundi, but did not mean to stay there. He has two assegai wounds in the thigh, neither of them serious, and he sent Baleni, an innceku, to tell the chiefs to send down this message, and also to let Mnyamana know that he (the King) is alive.' Nomahobodiya reached Bishopstowe on Aug. 4. He was one of those who brought down the King's letter of July 16 and had hurried back to Zululand to learn the truth on the first reports of the surprise at Ulundi. He and Kukula state as follows: \u2014'No impi had gone out from Ulundi; there were portions of nine regiments there, but two of them only in name, as their companies were not filled up yet. The King had intended to send three or four regiments to Mnyamana's assistance, on hearing that Usibepu's party had sent an impi into the King's territory to support Hamu in his rebellion. But when these regiments had been prepared and were ready to start, they were stopped by Mr. Fynn, who came to the King and said, \"You arc forbidden by the conditions to send out any impi. Have nothing to do with Mnya- mana. Do you just remain quietly at home, and let the enemy come and attack you here in your own place, that it may be plain that you are not responsible for the fight- ing.\" So the King gave way, which greatly disheartened the men, for the impi was broken up\u2014that is, the men were not kept in fighting array, but were set to work in- stead in cutting wood for the building of the kraal, &c. But it was always the same. Whenever a party was sent out whether to cut wood, or to burn the grass, or hunt- ing, or scouting\u2014since Usibepu's party had threatened to attack Ulundi itself \u2014Mr. Fynn would come and say that they must go back, as he was sure that they were going against Usibepu's party ; and so it came to pass that this impi was first seen, spreading itself out to surround the kraal, one portion about a mile off, another a very little further in another direction. The sun was just up (? about 715 a.m.) and large parties of men were away, some of them gone to their wood-cutting, some to the river to wash, others to fetch water, some were escorting home the parties of girls who had come bringing food to the Royal kraal, while those who remained were not kept in any particular order, the impi having been broken up ; while the kraal was full of women, too, who had come both from the King's territory and the Reserve, and were preparing the thatch for the huts. The alarm was given by one of our own people, and just then Makahleleka, the Swazi prince, rode up, for the enemy had passed by the kraal where he was lodging, and he had hastened to warn the King. Our meu rushed out to meet the enemy, not as an impi in lighting array, but just as working people hurrying from their work and all abroad. There wan no time even to marshal those who were there So the enemy with their horses soon scattered them, and reached the kraal and burnt it, killing chiefs and old men, women and children, the (uNdhlunkulu) Royal female attendants, andnumbers of the working women, killing (some of) the King's own wives and children. The dead bodies of three of his wives and of three of his father's wives have been found, some of them four or live miles from Ulundi, and the dead body, too, of bis little son Nyoniyentaba (six years old), whose mother, too, is wounded by the same assegai which stabbed her child to death in her arms. Many people who had not time to get out they burnt to death in the huts, and destroyed or carried off the King's property, even the presents which had been given to him in England. How the King was saved we know from Baleni, who was told by the King himself and the girls who were with him. Mr. F. W.C'hesson writes as follows in Monday's Times from the Aborigines' Protection Society's chambers : \u2014 \"In the early part of Jidy Usibepu despatched ten companies of troops to assist Hamu in his rebellion against Cetewayo, a rebellion which the latter would have had no difficulty in suppressing if he had been allowed to enforce his authority. Mr. Fynn, however, in accordance, no doubt, with his instructiuns, warned Cetewayo that if he organized a military force, or resorted to hostilities, he would be guilty of violating the conditions imposed upon him at his restoration. Probably Sir Henry Bulwer trusted to his being able to induce Usibepu to remain quiet, but his messengers appear to have been unable to communicate directly with that chief, who, moreover, had no Resident with him. At any rate, ture is good reason to believe that the surprise and defeat of Cetewayo are mainly due to bis having been forbidden, at the critical moment, to act in self-defence.\" The lHi.ly Sews learns that the first intelligence of the safety of Cetewayo was communicated to the Natal Government by a messenger from the King named Kukula. He told Mr. John Shepstone that Cetewayo demanded that the matter of hia surprise and attack by Zibebu, as well as the slaughter of his people should be inquired into, \" because Zibebu's party would never have attempted this thing if they had not been backed up.\" Milwana, another messenger from the King, arrived at Bishopstowe on August 10. He stated that Mnyamana and N'dabuko were coming to Cetewayo with the main army and tlie Abaqulusi division, adding:\u2014\" Jhe King is sending messengers to the Governor, to Mr. Fyun, and to Mr. Osborn to report this attack on him and massacre of his people and of his own family, and to claim that his brother Siteku and others who have been taken captive be recovered for him, since this has happened through his being forbidden to protect himself and bis own people.\" In the lh-st reports of the attack on Ulundi it was stated that Cetewayo's son was killed. A correspondent of the Daily Scwe at Durban, whose letter is dated Aug. 12, thus explains what occurred:\u2014\"Dinazulu, the Kin\u00ab's son, escaped. His second son was only four years old, and was on his mother's back when she made ber escape from Ulundi. The poor creature was over- taken by Zibebu's men, and the child was stabbed to death on her back, the assegais penetrating the mother, who, when I heard, was still alive. Din&zulu is there- fore the King s only son.\" Cape Town, Aug. 28.\u2014Cetewayo is stated to have been visited in the lnkamhla Bush by Transvaal Boers, who have taken his sons to Utrecht for safety. Cete- wayo's people are swarming to him. Mayamana and Undabuko with a large impi are concentrating in Cete- wayo's neighbourhood. Some companies of the Welsh Regiment, under the command of Lieut.-Col. Montgomery, have been ordered to Fort Pearson on the Tugela as a corps of observation and for the protection of the Natal border. Cetewayo is practically taking possession of the Reserve Territory. Advices from Basutoland show that a large majority of the Basutos are now decidedly in favour of the resumption of the Imperial role. Masupha's people are dissatisfied, and are trekking to the Orange Free State and elsewhere. Captain Blyth's popularity is rapidly increasing, and the Basutos express regret that he was not sent to them before. Durban, Kept. 17 (Heuter). \u2014A detachment of artillery, with a large convoy of ammunition and a squadron of dragoons, have been ordered to proceed immediately to Etshowe. The object of the expedition is believed to be to make a demonstration in the Reserve Territory. Pabulamami. Cetewayo's brother, who was recently arrested at Greytown, while coming from laaadola with- out a pass, has been reprimanded and sent back to Zulu- land under escort. Durban, Sept. 18.\u2014The Usutns have attacked Oharn. The result is unknown. A statement that Sir Henry Bulwer has sent an ultimatum to Cetewayo demanding that he should within 10 days sui render himself to Mr. Osborn is incorrect and unfounded.

Bulgaria.\u2014Sofia, Sept. 16. \u2014The extra- ordinary session of the Bulgarian National Assembly was opened to-day by Prince Alexander. In his speech from the throne, his Highness, after adverting to the proofs of paAriotiam and devotion to his person shown by the deputies during the last session of the Assembly, uud bidding them welcome on the occasion of their resuming their labours, 'said he had convoked them to examine and ratify the Convention signed by the Con- ference k Quatre providing for the union of the Turco- \u2022Servian railways in conformity with the stipulations of the Treaty of Berlin. Be recommended the Assembly to give the matter its earnest consideration in order to prove that Bulgaria did not shrink from the performance of the duties imposed on her by international treaties. The Prince further announced that a Convention bad been concluded with Russia with regard to the cost* of the Russian occupation of the Principality subsequent to the last war, the charges for whiqh devolved upon Bulgaria under the Berlin Treaty. Prince Alexander concluded his speech with the following words: \u2014*'lavail myself eagerly of this opportunity to assure my beloved people that my sole aim is, and always will be, to promote the greatness and independence of Bulgaria and the happiness of my subject?.\" Switzerland. \u2014Miss Booth has been put in prison at Neuchatel for attending a religious meeting, and \"Colonel\" Clibborn has been expelled from the canton of Geneva for singing a hymn at a funeral. The Constitution of the country in which these things hate come to pass guarantees to every citizen the fullest religious freedom, and a treaty between England and Switzerland places subjects of the Queen on the same footing in every respect as natives of the country, hat even the Geneva Council of State would not dare to punish a Swiss citizen for singing a hymn. India.\u2014A Beuter's telegram from Simla states that, in addition to limiting the jurisdiction under the Bill to district, magistrates and SMrimu judges, it if proposed to modify the Ilbert Bill so as to allow Euro- pean cases to be transferred to the high oourt# when their transfer is regarded as expedient, and likely to further the ends of justice.

The Luther festival (the 400 th anniversary) was opened on the 13th by the German Crown Prince, The visitors to the town were estimated at 50,000, and over 1000 clergymen were present, including deputations from England, France, Russia, and Hungary. The Princes attended service, and afterwards went to the Castle church, where the Crown Prince placed a laurel wreath upon Luther's grave. At the subsequent opening of the Luther Hall his Imperial Highness made a speech, in which he .said: \u2014May this festival serve as a holy exhortation to us to uphold the great benefits of the Reformation with the same courage as was displayed in acquiring them for us. May it above all strengthen ns in the resolution to be ready at all times to defend the Evangelical creed, and with it liberty of conscience and religious toleration. The strength and essence of Pro- testantism do not rest upon any stiff form of written words, but in the striving after the knowledge of Christian truth. May Luther's anniversary help to strengthen Protestant feeling, preserve the German Evangelical Church from disunion, and lay for her the foundation of lasting peace. A curious attempt at blackmailing was some time ago reported from New Haven, Connecticut. A young man named Isaac Lockwood, who had been ajeweller in New York, contrived, while living in a retired village in Con- necticut, the following ingenious scheme for making him- self rich at the expense of the dishonest among his fellow* creatures: \u2014He sent out to every banking-house in the State, and to many in England, copies of a circular set- ting forth that the writer was in a position to afford sub- stantial assistance towards putting themselves right to cashiers or bank clerks who would confess to him frankly that they had embezzled the money of their employers and promise to reform for the future. The circular ex- plained that a retired banker had lately died leaving nearly 800,000 dollars, which he wished to be devoted to the purpose just indicated. His reason for giving such a singular direction with regard to the disposal of his wealth was that, when a young man, he had used for his own purposes 80,000 dollars out of the funds of a bank with which he was then connected, and had been rescued from ruin by a benevolent old gentleman who bad con- sented to make his defalcations good, on condition that he promised to abstain from bad ways in future, and, if he should ever be rich, to spend as much money as that advanced to him in saving some others from dishonour. Unfortunately, the young man thus rescued grew old without ever discovering a fitting subject for his charity, and now an \"old and tried friend\" of his was endeavour- ing, by issuing this circular, to carry out his dying wishes. This was Mr. Isaac Lockwood's bait. It is stated that \" scores of men gulped it down,\" until tbo rascal was in possession of a long list of confessions of dishonesty from the States, and, it seems, several from England. Lock- wood was soon detected, and has been sentenced to a year's hard labour. Princess Victoria.\u2014The Standard's Berlin correspondent is informed that the marriage of Princess Victoria of Hesse to Prince Louis of Battenberg will take place, not in the autumn at Windsor, but next February at Darmstadt. Lord Coleridge in America. \u2014A brilliant public reeeption was given to Lord Coleridge at the Casino, Newport, on Thursday. A Daily News telegram says: \u2014 \"The reception committee comprised over a hundred of the most eminent summer residents, including Mr. John Jacob Astor, the two Vanderbilt3, and distin- guished lawyers, judges, artists, and merchants from all parts of the country. The Casino was handsomely deco- rated with the English and American flags and tropical plants. An address engrossed on vellum was read by Judgo Blatchford, of the Supreme Court of the United States, cordially welcoming the Lord Chief Justice of England to this country. Lord Coleridge, in replying, said that the great position he had the honour to occupy came to him solely by the long-continued, though un- deserved, good opinion of one man whom he had ever recognized as his political leader\u2014the great and illus- trious person who now fills the office of Prime Minister of England. The speech was informal, and consisted mainly of playful allusions to the criticisms upon each other's perfections so much indulged iu by Englishmen and Americans. In the evening Judge Blatchford gave a banquet to Lord Coleridge at the Casino, at which many distinguished persons were present.\" Singular Wtdding.\u2014The marriage of Carl Bossbard and Elise Clay Hastings is a romance. Four years ago a Swiss colony was established near Atalanta, among whom was the single young man Bosshard. Hav- ing thriven, he sent for his sweetheart in Switzerland. She was met by her lover. She could not speak a word of English, and no preacher in the town understood the language. In this dilemma the Rev, Dr. Jones appointed the groom interpreter, and by this means the questions were put and answered. The marriage took place in Dr. Jones's parlour, and was witnessed by a large number of ladies, who expressed their sympathy for the bride by the natural language of kisses.", "id_issue": "0000237_18830921", "id_newspaper": "0000237", "page": "0003", "title": "General of the Week."}], "1889-11-22": [{"content": "OCR Reporter for the Western Gazette and Pulman's Weekly News in the Wells, Shepton Mallet, Axbridge, and Glastonbury district is Mr. J.

Flsmmarion, the In Defence or well-known French the Moon. astronomer, has been standing up in de- fence of the moon. He thinks she is en- titled to a verdict of not proven when she is accused of causing volcanic explosions and earthquakes when at her nearest to the earth. He admits that appearances are against her in connection with the catas- trophe at Martinique. That coincided with the new moon at a time when the moon was particularly near the earth and when the sun was pulling the same way with the moon, for there was an eclipse of the sun that day, and both luminaries were right overhead at Martinique. All these things look very suspicious, but the astronomer is not inclined hastily to jump to conclusions adverse to the moon. He points out that the second explosion at Martinique took place on May 20, two days before full moon, when the moon was near the farthest distance from the earth, and when the sun ond moon were not pulling together, and yet the explosion of May 20 was very vio- lent, and he also points out that the erup- tion at Krakatoa, which was much more violent, took place on the day of the last quarter cf the moon, when, therefore, the moon was not at her nearest to the earth. These points certainly are in the direction of fuller inquiry before the sentence of con- demnation of the moon is made absolute, and therefore it is well to know that there will occur opportunities within the next two months of testing whether the moon is on mischief bent every time when she is particularly near the earth, when the moon is full and right overhead at Martinique this month, and again at full moon in January, when she will be as near the earth as she was when the catastrophe occurred in the month of May, and at the full moon on the 15th of December she will be nearer still than in May.

BANNER, B.A. (Oxon.)\u00bb F.R.G.S., has written \" Great Disasters of the World\" (London: Hurst & Blackett, 12s 6d), dealing with 18 catastrophes that have startled the world. The author has confined himself to those that are likely to have become dimmed by time in the memories. Some are included because of the toll of life involved, and others for the intensity of their drama or for the great material damage done. It is interesting to note that he begins with the Tay Bridge horror, and here is a chapter that will be read with interest by both the old who remember it and the young who from time to time inquire about it. It is a grim story \u2014the tale of a bridge whose \" slender beauty awakened misgiv- ings\" in certain quarters. \" Hard-headed, unromantio engineers in Cleveland had all voiced grave doubts as to the advisability of limiting the width of the bridge to a single line, arguing that such narrowness could not help but entail a loss of material strength.\" So it happened. Other disasters that are vividly described are the great eruption of Krakatoa, in the Straits of Sunda, in 1883; the Chicago holocaust of 1871; Boston's big blaze of 1872; the end of the Titanic, at one time the world's greatest liner; the Gretna troop train smash of 1915, in which the 7th Royal Scots were heavily involved; the Princess Alice fatality, a tragic collision in the Thames when the ship of that name with 900 people aboard was sunk; the St Cloud tornado terror; flood and flame in Pennsyl- vania ; the destruction of \" Frisco\"; the Mont Blanc affair at Halifax, &c. The whole makes an interesting record. Not a Serious Attempt! There ars so many descriptions one could apply to A. A. Milne's book, \" Two People \" (London: Methuen, 7s 6d), that it is nothing short of remarkable its publishers should have hit upon one that is so utterly wrong. \" Two People \" is described as \"Mr Milne's first serious attempt at the novel,\" which it decidedly is not. In the first place, \" Two People \" is not really a novel; it is more an essay, though a remarkably interesting essay, on mar- riage. Secondly, it is by no means a seri- ous attempt. This fantastic story of a beekeeper, who is also a best seller, contains some delight- ful reading, and also some examples of whimsicality that are to say the least, trite. Reginald Wellard, beekeeper cum novelist, was madly in love with Sylvia, his wife, even after some years of marriage. For twenty- three hours out of the twenty-four he thanked the gods for their gift of Sylvia; in the other hour he wondered whether they had not given him just a beautiful doll. One is inclined to agree with this latter view, though Sylvia's complacent acceptance that her mission in life is just to look beauti- ful commands admiration because of its very self-sufficiency. \" I expect it's what I'm here for,\" she says with utter conviction. \" Two People \" contains a well-developed germ of originality. Here and there Mr Milne reveals flashes of his abundant humour, and for this alone \" Two People \" might profitably be read. Dog Days. For all dog-lovers the 60 beautiful photo- graphs in Major Harding Cox's \" Dogs of To-Day \" (London: A. & C. Black, ss), will be the first attraction of this volume. The 60 pictures are of perfect specimens of our most famous breeds of dogs. But the letter- press is also of very considerable value. In his introduction the author deals with \"The Evolution of the Dog,\" and he has a little article facing each photograph and deal- ing with the breed pictured in it. These articles are full of sensible information and suggestions, and it is good to see an expert writing of Cairns and West Highlands as follows: \u2014\" I have noticed with sorrow that, as in several other cases, the female section of breeders seem to be intent upon reducing the size of the Cairns or Whites, as the case may be, to a minimum. If they persist in this pernicious pursuit we may soon see these two beautiful sporting breeds reduced to the level of the so-called toys.\" We Stand Corrected. For six years Dr Karl Silex has been Lon- don correspondent for a leading German newspaper, so that his acumen and craft are guaranteed, as also the significance of his observation. These qualifications are apparent in his book on \" John Bull at Home \" (London: Harrap, 8s 6d). This com- prehensive commentary is accusative and corrective, in a shrewd, witty, and kindly way. Dr Silex writes not only to divert but also to instruct. His Teutonic methodicity and thoroughness are specially prominent and serviceable in a chapter entitled \" Concern- ing Living Accommodation.\" In this he relates his own experience of house-hunting and houses. Dr Silex is similarly factual in observations on the cost of amusement in London. His pointed criticism stabs, and there is tartness in his humour. But his good intent is as strong as his sense, and his book is far more readable than most novels. Tales of the Open. William Byron Mowery is fast forcing himself to the front of fiction writers in Canada. He * aac ? 6 ,, a decided hit in \" Heart of the North, and his latest effort, \" The Flaming Mesa ' (London: Stanley Paul, 7s 6d), is no acceptable. It is a romantic story of the North. The mounted pphee do not figure in the book. The hero is a young airman in the service of the Canadian Government. He shields Aurore M JNain, a pretty young fugitive, and as the result finds himself in many tight situations, including an air fight over a Canadian lake. If fault can be found it is in the too numerous descriptions of the heroine, but this is atoned for in the remarkable know- ledge of bird and animal life in the wilds. The author knows his subject and gives some excellent descriptions. Ridgewell Cullum is another who knows his Canada, and better still, he knows the rough pioneer who has helped to build the Empire. His pen is racy and he is the Great Disasters Recalled master of detail. In his book, \" The Treasure of Big Waters,\" he gave us a vigorous and forceful story, and it is safe to say he will score again in his latest novel, \" The Bull Moose (London: Chap- man & Hall, 7s 6d). Here we have a grim story of life lived close to nature. It is set in the border land of Canada and Alaska, where a hundred souls live only for gold. The story is of life in the raw, and Cul- lum sees to it that it is carried to the final page. There is no happy-ever-after ending to the book; instead tragedy in a cruel form is its final keynote. Doctor Disciples. From the first century Christian disciple- ship has been manifest in the lives and work of doctors. St Luke was a medical man, so was the author of \" Religio Medici,\" and so was the sunny-souled melancholic whose yearning humanness lives in \" Rab and His Friends.\" The list is enlarged to. 14 in a studious and potent little volume entitled \"St Luke and His Brotherhood \" (Edin- burgh: Marshall, Morgan & Scott, 2s). The work is tractarian, but not in the old heavy style. It is very readable. Important Questions. Norma Lorimer deals with some extremely controversial questions in \" Alone\" (Lon- , don: Hutchiaon, 7s 6d). She deals with them so thoroughly that one is almost inclined to forget the story \u2014which, be it said, has tremendous appeal. Muhammadanism, politics of Morocco, and the colour question are closely interwoven with the thread of the story, which deals with the life of Margaret Morrison. The heroine is taken to Morocco and left to earn her own living. How her life is influenced by different men and how fate ultimately deals with her is admirably told. A book which should be read by all who look for more than the mere conventional story. An Old Problem. A titled young Englishman's admiration for a girl of mixed parentage accounts for the interest of Anne Duffield's novel, \" Passionate Interlude\" (London: John Murray, 7s 6d). Lord Carlyon's consuming desire for the lovely Annunciata endures while he remains in Cairo, but in England it dies under the hauteur of his stately mother and the proud traditions of his ancestral home. The lady has been invited to Carlyon Abbey, and there she acts in the way hoped for She returns to Egypt to marry happily her Italian kinsman. Impossible\u2014But Lively. Under normal circumstances no Prime Minister would commit important despatches for Paris to the charge of anyone other than a King's Messenger, least of all to a man in peril from a gang of cunning criminals. The thing, however, is done in James Cor- bett's very lively novel, \" The White Angel\" (London: Herbert Jenkins, 7s 6d). The hero delights in detective work, ana Scotland Yard invites his aid in running to earth the murderer of a prominent politician. The latter's daughter joins in, and there is hurry-scurry of incident that excites the jaded sense. When Suspicion Came. Richmal Crompton's exceeding ability is revealed in the craft pnd credibility of Portrait of a Family '' (London: Mac- millan, 7s 6d). This is a poignant story, concerning a retired doctor whose wife in dying had whispered what had seemed to him a confession of infidelity. His wedded experience had been ideally happy. But the brightness is swept from his memories, and, tortured by dark suspicions, he assumes an appearance of content, and enters into the far from untroubled affairs of his grown-up family. There is an almost startling suggestion of authentic features in the deft but strong portraiture, and in the air and look and sound of incidents in the domestic drama enacted by brothers and sisters alike, yet strangely unlike.

Mr. Partridge has improved upon the dragon known to heraldry by the addition of a Welsh-woman's steeple hat and frills around the neck. It is a most spirited draw- ing, and full of minute and carefully-executed detail. Curiously enough, June 26th was chosen to be Queen Victoria's Coronation Day, but it was dis- carded a comparatively short time before owing to the fact that someone about the Court suddenly remembered that it was the anniversary of the death of the \"First Gentleman in Europe.\" Only one British monarch has been crowned on Christ- mas-day ; that was William the Conqueror, in 1066. Sunday used to be quite a favourite Coronation Day, and was chosen by the masterful Henry VTIL for the crowning of himself and his unfortunate first Consort, Catherine of Aragon. Thursday Coronations have been comparatively rare. Charles I. was crowned on a Thursday, the Feast of the Purification, 1626. George IV. also chose tho same day in the week, and the last double Coronation\u2014that of William IV. and Queen Ade- laide^\u2014also took place on a Thursday, as did that, seven years later, of Queen Victoria. It is painted out that King Edward has selected the anniver- sary of Cromwell's installation for his own Corona- tion, for the great regicide was installed as Lord Protector in the Chair of Scotland, brought out of the Abbey into Westminster Hall on purpose, on Friday, June 26tb, 1657. It will be interesting to see what steps are taken in His Majesty's prisons next June to celebrate the auspicious event of that month. At the last Coronation all prisoners confined in Newgate, of whatever degree, were supplied by the Sheriffs with a pound of beef, a pound of potatoes, a pound of white bread, and a pint of strong beer, and those doomed to solitude were allowed to mingle for a short space with their fellowmen. In Bridewell the day was respected in Uke manner, and the \"oakum pickers\" and \" hemp beaters,\" as this class of cap- tives were called, had a day's holiday. In the Fleet Prison, immortalised by Pickwick, the warden bestowed half a gallon of porter upon each inmate, and the brewers who regularly supplied the gaol acted in like manner as at the other privileged prisons. Americans are intent on applying electricity to all possible uses. The latest is the employment of huge electro-magnets as lifting machines for iron or steel plates, bars, billets, ingots, and similar objects. At the yard of the New York Shipbuild- ing Company, Camden, N.J., one of these machines is at work, the electro-magnet being attached to the hook of a crane. According to the \" Scientific American,\" tbe crane operator can load and unload iron materials without any assistance, nothing more being needed than to bring the magnet into con- venient contact with the iron to be lifted. A cer- tain amount of risk exists, because, if the current should accidentally fail, the load would be dropped; but this peril is guarded against in most plants by the use of current from a storage battery. Ordinary magnets have a lifting power up to five tons, but of course they are rarely taxed to their full capa- city. At a recent test a single magnet lifted a mass of iron weighing 3,8201b5. More rat-hunts last week in London! The Buckingham Palace-road is being uttery trans- formed. A few years ago, the old red-brick houses with gardens in front of them on the west side of the road were pulled down to make room for modern flats, and now the same process i 3 being applied to the east side, for the much-needed exten- sion of the Brighton Station south of the Gro3venor Hotel. The old houses swarmed with rats, just as those between Holy well-street and the Strand did, and the rat-catchers have had a fine sporting time. An old coffee-house in the road had a score of 7C dead rats. Eight hundred were killed in the week, not to mention the many hundreds more which got away. This sort of thing makes one wonder how many rats there are in London, for they swarm whenever an old house is pulled down. It is not over-p!\u00b0asant to think that there are cer- tainly more rats than human beings in London. The new coinage, the five-pound and two-ponnc pieces, will give the country some beautiful coins, but it is doubtful if tiie heavier pieces will be much used. The Americans have some fine large gold coins, but, being practical people, they put them in the bank and carry about with them, when they require much money, a \"wad\" of \"green- backs.\" No man in England keeps a five-shilling piece in his pocket longer than he can help, anc in France the \" cart-wheel\" five-franc pieces are very clumsy to carry. In our Colonies where the Mexican dollar and the Japanese yen are the cur- rency\u2014the Straits Settlements and China\u2014no man ever carries auy money except the smallest change with which to pay chair or rickshaw coolies. Al other monetary transactions are carried out by chits. In any shop or club or restaurant an \" 1.0.U.\"' is signed for a purchase, and at the com- mencement of each month these are presented to the shroff of a firm or the butler of a private house, who settles the matter and delivers an account to his master. A bank-note has a number on it, and is not hopelessly lost even when it has been stolen; a five-pound-piece once out of pocket is gone for Australia has suffered heavily from the increase of a number of imported animals to the proportion of a plague. Tbe case of the rabbit is well known. It appears to be the turn of the fox now. Reynard was introduced a few years ago from Europe by a Colonist of a sporting turn, and has become a frightful pest in many districts. It is supposed that the foxes have formed a cross with the dingo, or native wild dog, aud the result is a variety that has all tho viciousness of both species in a high state of concentration. These creatures are not content with poultry. They attack sheep; and in one re- ported case a farmer is said to have lost 300 lambs in a few days. The graziers of South Australia are organising a war of extermination against the pest. The descent of a fireball into the sea off Dovei last Tuesday was an imposing spectacle. Such an event is rare, though not altogether unique. In February, 1399, news came from Brazil that a bril liant igneous body, afterwards proved to be of a metallic nature, had fallen on a deserted spot in tha country. It measured more than 10.000 cubic yards in buifc. If the recent visitant approached this in size, which, however, there seems no reason for thinking, it was, fortunate for the good people of Dovsir that its re-3ting-place was the sea. It i 3 not often that one of these wandering masses come so near our earth. The smaller shooting stars or meteors, at the beginning of their visible paths, are on an average about 80 miles high, and when last seen about 50. The larger objects, classed under the he3d of fireballs, come closer, and beginning their paths usually some 70 miles above us, approach to about 30. Normally the velocity of a meteor in space is about 25 miles per second; but fireballs move somewhat slower. There is apparently no limit to the wonders ol electricity. Wireless telegraphy seems to the un- scientific mind almost as supernatural as a miracle; but if it be true that Signor Marconi has succeedec in establishing communication by signals between St. John's, Newfoundland, and the Lizard, we can only wonder and admire. According to the tele- grams from Newfoundland, Signor Marconi claims to have received faint, though definite, precon- certed signals transmitted from the station in Corn- wall. The experiment appears to have been made by means of flying kites to which vertical wires were attached, and the receiving kite was fitted with a specially sensitive telephone. The scientific world will probably wait for further and more decisive results before accepting this solution of such a pro- blem, but, as far as the general public is con- cerned, they will not be surprised at any new development of marvels. The latest novelty in smart circles is the vaccina- tion tea. As the guests assemble\u2014lords and ladies, blondes and brunettes\u2014they pass into a little room, and there they are received by four stars of the medical profession. Needless to say, the latter vaccinate the former, but the interest of the whole function lies in the ingenious way in which the ladies deck thernselvfs for the occasion. They have theirs sleeves divided at the top. and then re-united with ribbons. When the ribbons are untied the coast is clear for the doctor. Everyone knows that the preparations of the for war were singularly complete, and that they confidently anticipated avictorious end to the struggle. It will probably be news to the English public, however, to be told that so minute were their arrangements, and so certain were they of success, that they even prepared the ribbon for the medals with which the breasts of tbe victorious burghers were to be d-xorated when the English had been driven into the sea. Thi9 really seems to savour a little of that selling the bear's skin during the lifetime of the bear, which the fable condemns. It has long been known that dust could be carried enormous distances in the upper layers o the atmosphere. The outpourings of Vesuvius anc Etna have fallen on the decks of shins hundreds of miles distant from the volcanoes; the red dust of the Orinoco country is regularly wafted to the Cape Verde Inlands; at certain seasons the fine sand of the Sahara is blown to the Maderias; anc the microscopic fragments of Krakatoa, after the stupenduous earthquake of 1883, were scatterec over a great part of tlie world. It is new, however to learn that ordinary man-built furnaces can pro- duce similar results. Professor Hartley and Mr. Ramoge have exa- mined the solid particles brought down in Ireland along with rain, hail, snow, and sleet, by means of the spectrograph, an instrument which deter- mines the composition of minute quantities of sub- stances by photographing their spectra. These they have compared with such matfrials as meteoric and volcanic dust, soot, and the fine pro- duots of chemical works and smelting furnaces. The residt is surprising. It appears that materials have fallen in Treland that were ejected by the Warn furnaces and metallurgical works in England and", "id_issue": "0000407_19011220", "id_newspaper": "0000407", "page": "0008", "title": "Notes from all Quarters."}], "1887-06-11": [{"content": "POETICAL.

The fastest Atlantic journey ever made has been achieved by the Cunard steamer Umbria, which arrived at New York on Saturday, after a passage of six days, two hours, and thirty-seven minutes. The Methodist New Connexion is about to consider the propriety of appointing Connexional Evangelists. It is said that the Primitive Methodists are talking of establishing a Connexional Orphanage. The Marquis of Hartington will address a Liberal 1 Unionist meeting at Manchester on the 24th instant. It is expected that he will take the opportunity of re- ferring to Mr. Gladstone's proposal of a conference. Owing to some accident to the machinery, a cage, which was descending the shaft of No. 2 pit, Dalyell Collieries, Motherwell, was precipitated to the bottom, three men being killed and three others much injured. A magnificent sturgeon has been captured in the Dee, Cheshire. The fish is the largest ever taken in these waters, and measures 7ft. Gin. in length, 36in. in girth, and weighs just over ljcwt. It was christened \"The Jubilee Sturgeon.\" The Queen who takes a great interest in the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, has con- sented to distribute the prizes and certificates awarded by that Society this year. The ceremony will take place in the Albert Hall. The directors of the Midland Railway Company have decided to give all the railway men a day's holiday on the Queen's Jubilee without deduction of pay. Those men who cannot be liberated on June 21st will have a day's holiday on some other day. Professor Huxley, speaking on Tuesday night in Marylebone, at a meeting in aid of the movement for a Free Public Library for the borough, said that to estab- lish such libraries was one of the most important and beneficent steps that could be taken in the present day. The fastest passage on record between Australia and this country lias been made by the Orient steamer Oroya, which reached Plymouth on Saturday, having made the run from Adelaide in 32 days 104 hours. A fog detained her twelve hours in the Channel, and practically the passage has been made in 32 days. Upon the arrival cf a North British Railway express at Cowlairs on Monday morning a gentleman, supposed to be Mr. Archibald Glendinning, aged forty, was found dead in one of the carriages. As no ticket was found upon him, it is surmised he had not time to purchase one, and ran so hard to cntch the train that death from heart disease ensued. Mr. Gladstone's suggestion of a Conference between himself and Lord Hartington is generally regarded as futile by the Liberal Unionists. They do not think ' that any basis for negotiation has been found ; and it is not believed that Lord Hartington would enter into any Conference unless there was some hope that it would lead to a satisfactory result. A woman named Anthony, wife of a seaman in the employ of the Cunard Company, and residing in Kirk- dale, a suburb of Liverpool, on Tuesday murdered two of her children and badly injured a third. She smo- thered one child, and cut the throats of the other two. They were aged ten months, two years, and three years. The woman is believed to be demented. At the Portsmouth Police-court, on Tuesday, a naval pensioner named Daniel Marsh was called as a witness in an assault case, in which his son was the complainant. After giving his evidence without any sign of excitement he sat down. A minute later atten- tion was called to the fact that Marsh appeared to have fainted, and upon his removal outside life was found to be extinct. Notwithstanding the fact that accommodation will be found in Westminster Abbey for some thirteen thousand persons to be present at the Queen's Thanks- giving Service, vast numbers have of course been dis- appointed, and the Lord Chamberlain has no fewer than three clothes-baskets filled with the written applications of somebodies and nobodies who are vainly seeking for tickets of admission. The committee formed to commemorate the services rendered to the town of Birmingham by the Right Hon. John Bright, M.P., for over twenty-five years one of its representatives in Parliament, have presented to the town, through the Corporation, a handsome full- length statue of the right hon. gentleman in marble, executed by Mr. W. Bruce Joy. The statue is to be placed in the Public Art Gallery. An inquest was held at Black Rock, near Brighton, on Tuesday, on the body of Jesse Louisa Miller, thirty- seven, who was found dead on the beach at the foot of a cliff on Monday. She was head barmaid at the Royal Academy, and had on her person a return ticket to Victoria. A coastguard saw her walking on the top of the cliff, apparently in an agitated state of mind, and a few hours afterwards she was found below. An open verdict was returned. The Sioux Chief, Red Shirt, accompanied by his interpreter and one of Buffalo Bill's officials, visited the House of Commons on Tuesday night. Red Shirt, who was in his war paint, excited considerable interest among hon. members. Among others, he was intro- duced to Baron Henry de Worms, who asked him what he thought of the British Parliament. He said he did not think much of it, laws being passed much quicker iu his country than in this. The body of a female child has been found in the mud of the Regent's Canal, near the Chalk Farm-road. It appears that the water having been drawn off for the purpose of cleansing the bottom, a number of men and boys took advantage of the opportunity to wade among the pools of water for the purpose of catching the fish. Whilst so engaged, a man named Jewittcame upon the body of an infant, very much decomposed, and partly eaten by eels. A constable was at once sent for, and he removed the body to the station. The London correspondent of the Freeman's Journal of Monday says:\u2014l understand that Mr. Gladstone has decided upon a plan which will meet the objections of those who disagreed with his Home Rule Bill be- cause of the non-retention of Irish members at West- minster. It will provide for keeping the full Irish representation at Westminster for purely Imperial business only. Mr. Gladstone does not intend to state the details of his proposal on this head in Wales, but will do so when a regular opportunity in Parliament arises. It is reported that pieces of gold have been discovered by miners in the bed of the River Mawddach, North Wales, and investigation seems to confirm the state- ment that the bed of the river is impregnated with gold, which has probably been washed down from the hills. Some fifteen years ago a great rush was made to the neighbourhood of Dolgelly and the valley of the Mawddach, where a rich quartz of gold had been found. The Clogan mine was opened, a company, of which Mr. John Bright was one of the directors, was formed, and for some time upwards of 100 ounces of gold per week were sent away from the mine. The non-delivery of a telegram from Manchester last week was attended by some amusing circumstances. Some old tapestry was lent by Mr. Lichfield, the art dealer, to the Jubilee Exhibition, and requiring the return of a certain panel, he particularised it in his telegram by stating the size ana subject, \" Venus and Adonis,\" ending the message with sender's name, \" Lichfield.\" A clerk at once replied to \" Venus and Adonis, Lichfield,\" and after making every effort to deliver the message, the Post officials were constrained to wire back to Manchester that no Venus and Adonis could be found in the cathedral city. The Royal Ascot Race Meeting was commenced on Tuesday in very favourable weather, and in the pre- sence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and a large gathering of Royalties and the nobility. The sport was unmistakably good. The Jubilee Cup, a race in- stituted in honour of the 60th anniversary of her Majesty's accession to the Throne, was won by Mr. Vvner's Minting, the Duke of Westminster's St. Mirin being second, and Mr. O. Barclay's Bendigo and Mr. Hammond's Aintree jointly third. Minting, who ran second in the Two Thousand Guineas of 1336, has not been seen in public since he won the Grand Prize of Paris last summer. On Tuesday, a second sensational fac-simile ap- peared in the Times. The readers of that journal were astounded to find an entire page of the paper filled with a fac simile from the Irish World. The new revelation is the first of a series (says a London corres- pondent) which the public will find grow more and more interesting. For the present the Times, in pro- ducing its evidence to show the connection between Parnellism and Crime, will commence by disclosing evidence taken exclusively from Parnellite publications in Ireland and America. Later, however, secret fac- simile documents will be forthcoming, and conspi- cuous amongst them a certain cheque drawn by a cer- tain distinguished Nationalist upon a certain martyr. Next in importance to the grand pageant at the Abbey, nothing during Jubilee week will equal in point of attractiveness the great Labour Demonstration, or, to speak more by the card, the Working-men's Demon- stration in the grounds of the Crystal Palace on Satur- day, June 25th. It is believed that, thanks to the facilities in the way of cheap fares offered by the rail- way companies, at least two hundred thousand repres- entatives of labour, with their wives and families, will be present to witness the extraordinary programme issued by the management. The list of amusements offered is equal to that of an ordinary five-shilling day, and considering that several of the leading railway companies are issuing return tickets over eighty miles for half-a-crown, which tickets include admission to the Palace, the number present, should the weather prove favourable, will unquestionably be the largest on record. A Carthusian monk, writing to his niece in Scotland, has disclosed some interesting particulars of the visit paid by her Majesty recently to the famous monastery of the Grande Chartreuse. The Queen remained in the Grande Chartreuse four hours, and must have pene- trated into the mysteries of the community with some- thing like thoroughness. She did not dine because no dinner had been prepared, owing to short notice of the visit, but she partook of a collation of chocolate, bis- cuits, jellies, and confections of various kinds. Lean- ing that there was an English convert, the son of an English Protestant clergyman, in the cloisters, her Majesty besought an interview, and being piloted to the cell by the Father General, she talked to the young monk half-an-hour, and appears to have been charmed with his manner. The Carthusian, who narrates what passed, says the Queen \" recommended both herself and her faithful subjects to his good prayers.\" \"He was the first cloistered monk to whom her Majesty had ever opened her Royal lips,\" and she requested a little souvenir to remind her of her visit. Whereupon the son of St. Bruno gave her Majesty a small ancient silver crucifix, which, without the osculation whioh a good Catholic would have bestowed, she carefully put in onex>f her pockets. All this information was ob- tained from a Father of the Order who had attended a chapter-general of the Grande Chartreuse. Her Majesty's visit must, therefore, have caused no small degree of perturbation among the cloistered brethren.

Two boys were playing in a punt on the River Orwell, when they fell into the water. One of them, named Gunn, was rescued by a passer-by, and, on regaining consciousness, said his companion, a lad named Ilazell, was also immersed. The drags were used, and Hazell's lifeless body was recovered three- quarters of an hour later. The Honourable Artillery Company held a Church Earade in London on Sunday, and marched to St. otolph's Church, Bishopsgate. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, accompanied by the Duke of Portland, the Lieut.-Colonel of the Company, in- spected the men on the ground in the City-road, and afterwards attended the service, where the Rev. W. Rogers preached the sermon. A fatal accident occurred on Thursday afternoon week in Westminster Abbey. While the labourers were fixing the scaffolding inside the Abbey, one of the men slipped and fell on to some iron railings, the spikes of which pierced his body in several places. He was immediately released and conveyed to the Westminster Hospital, where he dicjd the same evening. The man had recently tramped from Manchester to London. Mr. Thomas' H. Ismay, of Ismay, Imrie, and Co., managing owners of the White Star Line of Atlantic steamers, has written to the Mayor of Liverpool sug- gesting the establishment of a fund to be called the Liverpool Seamen's Pension Fund, out of which \u00a320 per annum may be granted to old and worn out Liver- pool sailors. He offers to contribute as a Jubilee gift, and in celebration of the completion of his 60th year, \u00a320,000. A report has been received at Madrid from Morocco that has all the sound of a story from the \" Arabian Nights,\" although it is positively declared to be true. The report states that hidden treasure has been dis- covered in the palace of an old vizier, who died some time ago at Rabat, amounting to the truly enormous sum of ninety-five millions sterling. The Emperor, on its being brought to his knowledge, is said to have in- stantly confiscated it, and it is now being conveyed to the Imperial coffers at Fez. The conference of the Manchester meeting of Odd- fellows was resumed at Dover yesterday week. The proposition of the directors for an amendment of the rules providing for separate accumulation of district funeral funds being made compulsory, but allowing lodges to determine whether such funds should be in the hands of the lodge or the district, was carried unani- mously. This question has been agitated for years. Mr. John Rust, of Lynn, was elected G.M., and Mr. R. Eastwood, of Blackburn, D.G.M. Lawrance Donovan, who some time ago jumped from Brooklyn Bridge and from Niagara Bridge, plunged into the Thames from London Bridge on Sunday after- noon, in the presence of some five hundred spectators. A subscription was made for him, but he refused to ac- cept it, saying that the feat was a \" Jubilee jump.\" After striking the water, Donovan swam about two hundred vards, and was nicked up by a passing boat, which landed him at Old Swan Pier. Donovan contemplates jumping from Clifton Bridge.. Victor Rosenburgh, an effeminate looking young fel- low, with dishevelled hair, was charged at Liverpool Police-court on Monday with stealing a watch and chain belonging to Mrs. Ware, publican. He had been engaged to appear at a free-and-easy at Ware's, in his great character of the male barmaid. After he left, the watch was missed and found pledged. He was arrested in female attire in a public-house in Derby, appearing as the Jersey Lily and the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire. Committed to the Sessions. I A costly widow's cap is to be sent to the Queen as a Jubilee gift from the Queen Regent of Spain. It is made of priceless old Spanish lace, with an embroidery veil at the back, hanging almost to the ground, and a pearl diadem in front, the jewels being embroidered on the lace by Queen Christina herself, who is an accom- plished needlewoman. The cap is copied from an old portrait which Queen Christina found in the palace at Madrid, representing a widow of the Spanish Royal house in the gala costume of three centuries ago. A shocking triple murder was perpetrated at Colne, near Burnley, on Saturday. Harriet Rushton, aged thirty-five years, had been walking with her husband and three children \u2014seven, five, and two and a half years old respectively. At four o'clock the husband left them, ana two hours later Mrs. Rushton called at her sister's house and said she had sent all the chil- dren to heaven. On the sister going to Mrs. Rush- ton's residence, she found that the children had been strangled. It is believed that the woman is insane. At the Longtown Petty Sessions (Cumberland), twelve men, described as fanners, farmers' sons, farm labourers, a shepherd, an innkeeper, and a gentleman, were charged, two of them with torturing four cocks by arming them with artificial spurs and inciting them to fight, and the other ten with aiding and abetting, at Penton. The case was proved by Police-sergeant Smith, who with two constables had been concealed in a planta- tion, whence they saw several battles fought. Francis Forster and Arthur Graham, who had pitted the birds, were fined 10/'- each, and the other defendants 5/- each. The publication of the life of Dr. Bunting, which was being prepared, has been delayed owing to the deatbfbf Mr. Percy Banting, his eldest son, but it will now be issued very soon. Another biography, that of the late Rev. Dr. Morley Punshon, is on the point of comple- tion. No minister in modern days made so deep an impression amongst Methodists of all shades through- out the world as aid Dr. Morley Punshon. The Rev. F. W. Macdonald, of Handsworth College, Birmingham, has been entrusted with the task of compiling a suit- _ble memoir.\u2014St. James's Gazette. . Lord Derby delivered an address at the annual meet- ing of the Liverpool Liberal Union Association on Fri- day evening. Speaking of the waste of time in the House of Commons, his Lordship said obstruction for the sake of obstruction was an offence against Parlia- ment; it discredited and lowered it in the public esteem, and as sach ought to be dealt with. Before long they would have to say to some Members, \" If vou do not understand decency, we do, and we intend to enforce it.\" His Lordship proceeded to argue that no measure which the English Home Rulers might pro- pose would settle the Irish question. An interesting reference is made to Queen Vicioria at the age of three months in a letter written by her father, the Duke of Kent, bearing the date 17th August, 1819. This letter, which, along with six others, fetched \u00a340 at a sale in Paris, contains the subjoined. passage:\u2014\" As to her resemblance to both of her parents, I may tell you that her mouth and her hair, whioh last promises to be dark brown, are like her mother's. Everybody says that her eyes and nose are mine. Yestercuiy she accomplished her twelfth week, and what is remarkable, she is as strong as a child of five months, and already shows symptoms of teething.\" The Bodyke evictions were continued on Monday, four tenants being ejeoted from their holdings. At the last house visited, that of a man named Cooney, a desperate resistance was offered. The house was barri- caded, and boiling meal was thrown at the Sheriff and bailiffs, the police having to point their rifles at the windows to prevent this being continued whilst the bailiffs broke a hole through the wall of the house. On the officials entering the premises through the hole, three women threw boiling meal at them, but they protected themselves from injury by means of an umbrella. The women were arrested, but afterwards released. An exciting scene was witnessed during the eviction of a tenant named Patrick Macnamara, on the Bodyke estate, on Tuesday. The front of the house being strongly defended, the Sheriff's assistants had to make a hole in the wall at the rear. As soon as they had done so, however, hot gruel and dirty water were hurled through the aperture at the emergency men, who nevertheless, when the breaoh was large enough, dashed through the opening, protecting themselves with umbrellas. Macnamara was afterwards removed in custody. MARK TWAIN savsofPitor.

It was not identified, but from the genera! appearance it was supposed to be that of the master of a ship. . . On Wednesday, David Bee, a saddler, carrying on busi- ness in Walkergate, Louth, committed BUicide. The unfortunate man Btood on the kitchen table, attached a rope to a hook in the ceiling, and when he had fastened it round his neck, jumped to the floor. His neck was broken. Ho was sixty-five years of age. The inquest on Mary Ann Yates, who was found dead at a house in Burton-crescent, London, under conditions which suggest the probability of murder, was resumed on Wednesday. Several witnesses were examined, but the evidence threw little light on the circumstances immedi- ately preceeding death, and the inquiry was again adionrned. . . , , Sir Arthur Scott died shortly before midnight on Tuesday, at bis seat at Great Ban, Staffordshire. The deceased was in his twenty-fourth year. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his brother'in 1871. Jn 1831 he was appointed a lieutenant of the Staffordshire Yeomanry Cavalry. He was a deputy-lieutenant of St On\u00b0 r Wednesday, at the Middlesbrough Police-court. Henry Worsley Jackson, an elderly man, who Mid he was a Master of Arts. Cambridge, and Doctor of Phil- osophy of Jena University, was charged with begging. He was a person of drunken habits, being intoxicated when arrested. He was sent to gaol for fourteen days Mr. Jardine, chairman of the Manchester Royal Ex- change, addressing the annual meeting of the snare- holders on Wednesday, attributed the present depression in the cotton trade to production having overtaken demand. He did not despair of the trade, and believed that during the next fifty years a further great develop- ment would take place. , The dead body of a betting man was found in a field near Derby on Wednesday morning. The man had lost heavily at Derby races on the previous day, and com- mitted suicide by taking laudanum.

A gun accident of a peculiarly distressing character has just occurred near Arneaby, Leioesterehire. A gentleman farmer named Wode was crossing a plank with his loaded gun in order to frighten some rooks from one of his fields, when it suddenly exploded, the contents entering his body. He was dead when found, and a little dog belong- ing to his daughter was whining piteously beside him. On Wednesday, English police-officers were placed on board the Chinese war vessel Nankin, moored in the Tyne, where she was about to embark artillery, made to the order of the Chinese Government, at the works of Sir William Armstrong, Elswick. It is supposed that the English Government has given orders for the detention of the vessel, in view of a possible war between France and China. , _ _ . At Knutsford, Cheshire, on Wednesday, Margaret Wilkinson was acquitted of the charge of attempting to poison her son and her daughter-in-law. _ Prisoner had insured the lives of a dozen of her relations, including her son, and the magistrates commented upon the laxity of a system which permitted these wholesale insurances without medical examination, or the knowledge of the persons assured. ... n . ... A shocking murder was perpetrated in Birmingham on Wednesday afternoon. For some reason unexplained, a parcels' delivery clerk named Thomas, who lodged at a coffee-house in Spring-hill, attacked his landlady, a young woman named Emma Hollis, with a clasp knife, inflict- ing a wound in the neck which proved fatal. He immedi- ately cut his own throat, and was not expected to Burvive. The woman was the wife of a soldier on service. At the Hull Police-court, on Wednesday, Henry Hirst and Thomas Huggins were charged with the wilful mur- der of Daniel Alleroyd, whilst an inmate of her Majesty s prison at Hull. Prisoners on several occasions beat and kicked the deceased, who afterwards developed symptoms of insanity, and was removed to the borough asylum, where it was found that several of his ribs were broken. He die* soon after admission. Prisoners were committed A retired Birmingham publican on .Tuesday drew nine \u00a3100 notes from a local oauk, and. getting very mtoxi cated, flourished the notes in the faces of the people in the streets, until be discovered that three of them were missing. On Wednesday morning, a man, almost in rags, presented himself at the police office and reported that he liad found three f 100 notes, which he shou d not have noticed had he not kicked them along the pavement. For his honesty, he has received a reward of 120. In making some excavations m ground formerly attached to the Manor House at Chelsea, built by Henry VIII. as a residence for his daughter, the Princess Elizabeth, the workmen came upon probably the only portion existing of a subterranean communication lead- in\" northwards from the three great houses\u2014Manor House, Winchester Palac?, and Shrewsbury House-in the direction of Kensington. About 30 feet of it, in good preservation and carefully arched, has been uncovered. John Pryce, a farmer, living near Bangor, on Wednes- day afternoon killed his stepmother by cutting her throat with a razor. No other persons were in the house at tne time. One of the farm servants, on returning to the house, found the woman lying dead on the floor, and tne man in an adjoining bedroom, with his throat cut. Pryce is said to have been drinking heavily lately. He died from his injuries late on Wednesday night. The cause of the murder is believed to be that the stepmother was going to be married, and would thus deprive Pryce of a joint interest in the farm. At the Lambeth Police-court, on Wednesday, Seymour Boyer Relton (26) was charged with the wilful murder of Mary Relton, his mother, at Spencer-road, Brixton, by cutting her throat with a razor. Harriet Heffin, servant of deceased, said that on Tuesday soon after three o'clock, she heard someone fall in deceased's bedroom and went up. She saw prisoner standing over the deceased. His left hand was smeared with blood. He said he had cut her throat. The police evidence was that Dr. Barra- clough said deceased could not have done it herself. Pri- soner's clothes were blood-stained. He was remanded till Tuesday next. , , . An unusual phenomenon was observed during the recent voyage of the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Paramatta to Sydney, New South Wales. On Dec. 11th and the following day, about lat. 10 deg. south, and long. 92 deg. east, the surface of the sea was covered with lava and pumice, some being as fine as sawdust and of a yellowish calour, but several patches of large extent were passed through with masses of pumice from the size of a cocoa-nut to that of a hogshead; this extended over 5 deg. of latitude, and probably much more of longitude, as the densest patches all ran in an easterly and westerly direc- tion. This would lead to the conclusion that a submarine upheaval must have taken place long after the great eruption of Krakatoa, in the Strait of Snnda, which wis over eight hundred miles distant. In the Court of Appeal, on Monday, the jndges decided that the verdict of \u00a35,000 damages for the plaintiff in the libel case of Belt v. Lawes should stand, with costs against the defendant. Before the appeal, Mr. Lawes had rejected a suggestion that the damages should be reduced to \u00a3600, and litigation ended. The question was whether Mr. Belt possessed sufficient\" artistic merit'' to execute cer- tain busts which had emerged from his studio, but which his detractors alleged to be the handiwork of a sculptor named Ver Heyden, or of someone else. Mr. Belt, it was alleged, made a feint of modelling before visitors, the real artist having glided silently through a door con- structed for the purpose as soon as a stranger was announced. No public man could allow suoh an asper- sion to go unchallenged without inviting ruin and dis- grace. It was proved in the court itself, that Mr. Belt could model with very considerable skill. The litigation must have kept the plaintiff's mind in a state of prolonged tension for some eignteen months, but he has now the less reason for regret since bis professional reputation has been cleared by three successive tribunals from the ruinous imputation which had been fastened upon it. Defendant Lawes was ordered to pay the costs. Applica- tion for a stay of execution was made, pending an appeal to the House of Lords; but the Master of the Rolls said that, after seventeen people had found that this charge was most unfounded, he would not stay execution for twelve hours.\u2014The Pall Mall Gazette says:\u2014The state- ment that Mr. Belt's costs will come to \u00a35,000 is con- siderably below the mark. They will amount, after taxation, to close upon \u00a39,000, so that the judgment and execution will be for about \u00a314,000. Mr. G.

There are several ways in which cvrfing may be carried to excess. One is the climbing of hills, which feels to be too much for him, as I nave gested above. Another is the senseless habit of \" scorching.\" Then, again there is the practice of racing with other fellows on uLe road-a piece of folly when you know them, and a bit of very bad form when you do not. Lastly, even among those who do not ride too hard up hills or too fast upon the level, there is still a not uncommon fault ol keeping at it longer than is wise or good. The fellow or the girl who keeps doggedly riding after the pleasure of riding has ceased is unconsciously giving hostages to the future, and is throwing away possibilities oi the keen delights of the road m years t come. The motive for plodding on with hait- exhausted powers is usually a very poor one-. It is often because \" So-and-So, withwhom you ride, is a stronger rider than you are, and vou perhaps don t want to let lum see it. Well, I'll admit that theVe \u00bb something savouring of sport in the idea, butjtmay really at times be eo very mischievous in other ways that I would urge all rears esehew it altogether. For all cases \u00bbf bocml riding, in companies of two or . should bo definitely understood that it is the business of the weakest and slowest rider to set the pace. If there is one of the paitj who cannot conform to this the only decent wav of getting on with him let him indulge in occasional \"bursts, and then wait about until the mam bo y comes up with him. \u2014Captain. The Late Lady Salisbury. The marriage of Lord Salisbury took p ace in 1857. Miss Georgina Caroline Aider son, eldest daughter of Sir Edmund Hall AJdei- son, one or the most brilliant judges who ever occupied the position of a baron oi t e Exchequer, was the lady who from that day forward until her death, forty-* 7l *' o afterwards, shared with Lord Salisbury the varied fortunes of his lifo- .At first there were the more or less precarious years dur- ing which, as Lord Robert Cecil, aud fien as Lord Cranborne, he was, as ho said at a dinner of the Press lund, no stranger to the anxieties, the labours, and the rewards of the newspaper press, and afterwards there was the dignity and re- sponsibility of the position to which he at- tained as Marquis of Salisbury. It is im- possible for anyone unacquainted with the details of theit family life to measure the influence which this marriage had upon his career. Still something at least may be sur- xnised with an approach to certainty. AJ the descriptions or Miss Alderson as a gir agree in picturing her as one who would necessarily fill up and perfect the life of a man of Lord Salisbury's chafer and dis- position She was one of the brightest, cheeriest, even merriest people possible. She was as clever in her way as he is his, and in one respect, viz., the gift of writing, th y had much in common. She was remarKab y keen and interested in anything that came in her wav, and was of a more practical nature than her husband. The main point of difference between them, however, la> probably in the brightness and liveliness of her disposition. Beneath this there lay a solid foundation of goodness and piety, mak- ing a combination of the greatest value, and enabling her to give Lord Salisbury an amount of support and help in his over whelming labours, which will never be more than guessed at by the world at large. ladv who knew the Aldersons well, and who was often present at their merry parties in Park Crescent, says:\u2014 She was one of the wittiest and cleverest people I bave ever known, and once it chanced that I had a few minutes talk with her that made me feel how much more there was. This I ha*c never forgotten.\"\u2014Good Words. From a Woman's Notebook, A woman whose word was really weighty once said that a lady only appeared on the streets in black, grey, or white. What would she say to us nowadays? Pink is a popular colour; some of it pretty, much of it very loud and unpleasing. But pink, you know! A colour really for the ballroom. g There is much to be said in favour of grey. Nothing looks better when a little white i- judiciously arranged next to the face. \"The mere man\" says he doesn't care \" tuppence\" about his clothes. It's a happy accident, then, that makes him wear white below his face. Even the plain-looking man looks clean and wholesome when his linen is beyond reproach. How pretty is that fashion of the girl oi eighteen, the maiden who stands ' with trembling feet where woman- hood and childhood meet.\" I mean the plait of hair, neatly turned up and finished with a wide bow. The \" knowing\" girl gives the side pieccs, of her hair an outward twist or two before she begins to plait it. That makes it wave loosely above the ears.

The first part of the book shows the Lady Noggs still a child and of a disposition it must be confessed much attuned to naughtiness of every descrip- tion. But she is always lovable, whether she is bullv-ragging her governess, defy- ing the neighbours, or bringing lines of care iuto the brow of her uncle and guardian. We are sorry to leave the Lady Noggs' childhood behind us, but we can almost forgive Mr Jepson for making her grow up. since he has shaped her into such a sensible, level-headed, and altogether charming young woman. To many the latter chapters of the book will give the greatest pleasure, for here we see the Lady Noggs fulfilling all the gracious promise of her youth.

A Fickle-M'nded Heroins. Possibly the moral of Mr Harold Simp- son's new story, \" Mrs Penrose's Philo- sopher,\" is to point out the dangers and temptations which surround the fickle- minded woman, but, apart altogether from its meaning, we find the tale a nice, light, and interesting one. The author has suc- ceeded in drawing his characters particu- larly true to life. After a short acquaint- ance with Mr Dalrymple, for instance, we discover ourselves comparing this man of the world to some intimate friend of our own. His sage and carefully phrased re- ferences to Mrs Penrose are what we hear from such men about such women every day. Mrs Penrose is, of course, the cen- tral figure. Having married a man she does not love, she seeks compensation in amusing herself with other men, but is bitten in the end. The author introduces dramatic touches with fine restraint and deftness in Mrs Penrose's meetings with a former lover whom she passionately loves, but we are disappointed with the end of the story, for Mr Penrose very conveniently dies. We felt entitled to a less fictional finis.\u2014Published by Greening & Co., Ltd., London, at 6s. Family Fortunes and Love.

Hazelhurst is the name of the estate of the Le Mesuriers, a family in reduced circumstances. Miss Hnzel Le Mesuriers, a handsome girl, is in a quandary as to how she can contri- bute her mite to retrieve the family for- tunes. She thinks of becoming a gover- ness, speculates on her chances as a typist, and is all the while distracted by rebel- lious brothers, one of whom is dismissed fiom his situation for shying an ink bottle at the head of an office colleague who had offended the Le Mesuriers' dig- nity. But a change of scene is reached by the arrival of the heir of Earnscleugh, a vast estate which adjoins Hazelhurst. Paul C-harteris, the wealthy owner, had been an attache iu the British Embassy at St Petersburg. Is it to be Paul or one, Digby Travers, who will wed Hazel ? The latter takes his disappointment badly, and it is only with the last page that we discover Hazel's sentiments toward Paul. In the meantime, the family fortunes have revived. The book is beautifu'ly got up, and the illustrations enhance its value.\u2014London : Simpson, Low, Marstou, & Co., Ltd. (Price, 65.) A Good-Hearted Vulgarian. \"Curtis Yorke\" is a practised hand at story-telling, and in her new novel, \" The Other Sara,\" she spins an excellent yarn out of very little material. The heroine is an elderly widow, the owner of an old furniture and curio shop in Limehouse, who, under the will of an ecoentrio re'a- tive, inherits \u00a310,000 a year, on condition that she lives with her nearest relative, paying \u00a3700 a year as board. As it hap- pens, this relative is a fashionable widow living in the West End of London, who. however, is thankful to get the \u00a3700, al- though the presence in her family of the good-hearted but voluble vulgarian is a constant thorn in the flesh. There are several threads of love interest, but the reader's main entertaiuTnent lies in the clever presentation under many lights of the character of Mrs Sara Grub, who is the good angel of the story. The novel, both in its comic and its sentimental scenes, runs along smoothly and easily, and will still further enhance the reputa- tion of \"Curtis Yorke.''\u2014London: John Long. (65.) Racing and the racehorse .ire. as usual, the setting of \u2022 A Bird in by Nat Gould (London: John Long & Co., 1*), and in this instance the '\"great sport\"' gives relish to his strong and able portrayal of human nature. A bread rein of humour, love, and villainy rune through the story/ Peeps into Pictureland. \"I like that\" is all the art criticism to which most people commit themselves, and precisely what attracts them in any par- ticular painting they can neither deter- mine nor express. Wo are all understood to admire pictures, but nobody comes for- ward to instruct us as to what qualities wo should look for in any great master. Hence it is that in many cases a visit to the chief Treasure Houses of Art is merely bewildering. We want someone to open unto us the locked treasures, and this has been excellently done in two new volumes of The Treasure House Series, ona dealing with the National Gal- lery, the other with the Wallace and Tate co'lections. The books have been devised specially for young people, but, except for an occasional pedagogic phrase, their con- tents are just as suitable for elder stu- dents making their first voyages into the fairyland of art. The gradual unfolding of the power of the painters, the character- istics of the age in which they lived, the charms of the rich personalities of the men themselves are vividly and clearly de- scribed. A wealth of anecdote makes greatly for interest, and the educative qualities of the books are enhanced by the excel'ent half-tone pictures illustra- tive of the different schools. In the volume dealing with the Wallace collec- tion there are chapters on Arms and Ar- mour, Porcelain and Majolica, and the other artistic and historic treasures \u2022of the collection. Miss Estelle Ross is re- sponsible for this work, and we can ima- gine no greater pleasure than to be at the 1 door of Hertford House with a whole Saturday to spare and this volume for guide, unless that be to make the tour of the National Gallery under the care of Miss Alice Cookran. Both books are pub- lished at 2s 6d net, nicely bound with medallion picture on front cover, and are published by Wells, Darton, & Co., Ltd., 3 Paternoster Buildings. The Web of Time\u2014How a Title Alone Survived. Does the title of a novel grow out of the story, or the story out of the title? The latter order is doubtless the ideal. Anyhow, it was thus \"The Web of Tinu\" (by Robert E. Knovrles) was born. First the tit'e, then the narrative, and the title was the only thing that survived the wreck. What wreck? queries the reader. A railroad wreck, replies the writer. I had almost half of \" The \"Web of Time carefully woven. Then came Feb. 24, 1907, on which date I was opening a church at Ottawa, our national capital. J took the fabric along with me. Home- ward bound, I bad the whole tvpe-written creation slumbering in my satchel. Then came the cataclysm\u2014a broken rail, the engine alone remaining. We were still at last, our car upside down. There is no Babel like the cry of the wounded mingling with the silence of the dead. I bad to break p window to crawl forth. I dragged my valise behind me as I crawled, bleeding and broken-shouldered, out into the heavenly'sunlight. A little child lay dead upon the snow, and my valise, with its cargo of thirty thousand startled words, lay beside the silent face while I helped, after a feeble one-shouldered fashion, to extricate a groaning fellow- man internally wounded. I was in bed when the thirty thousand hand-picked words were jubilantly restored to me. But \u2014and here is the strange part of the story\u2014l could not bring myself to use a word of the toil-bought stuff, snatched though it had been like a brand from the burning. I rewrote the story from the begitiing, the title alone surviving. If the rejecrted manuscript spoke at all from its sepulchre, it was but the murmur:-\u2014 Make me deeper, stronger, truer-\u2014you know better now who weaves the Web of Time. And I toiled on, the new bloom outbreaking from the dead, mortality swallowed up in life. I still saw the silent faces. , Nietzscha's Philosophy. \"There is no escaping Nietzsche,\" says Mr Henry L. Mencken in the introduction to his substantial volume, \" The Philosophy of Henry Nietzsche.\" \"He has coloured i the thought and literature, the speculation and theorising, the politics and supersti-' tion of the time-\" It may be said at once that for the purpose of studying Nietzsche \"there is no escaping\" Mr Mencken's book. It treats of \"Nietzsche the Man,\" \"Nietzsche the Philosopher,\" and \" Nietzsche the Prophet.\" Advanced students may find little that is new in the present studv, but it is to be recommended as the best exposition of the Nietzchian philosophy in the English language. It is written in a style that carries the reader along from page to page. The language is direct and vigorous, and there is no mis- taking where the author s sympathies lie. An obscure sentence will not be to\\ind in the who'e book, though many an in- adequate interpretation of views contrary to Nietzsche's will doubtless be noticed by critical readers. But take the work for what it protesses to be and its importance as a contribution to the subject with which it deals will be unanimously acknowledged. \u2014London: T. Fisher Unwin. (7s 6d net.) A Bishop's Piight. We have often read a worse written story than \"A Bishop's Plight\" (by Donald Thane). Indeed, the author has imagination, vivacity, and a pleasant fluency. What we have felt about his work is the want of breadth and atmosphere. Let him leave bishops and archdeacpns severely alone, and write a story about men and women- We think he could do it, and do it well.-\u2014London : Stanley Paul <fc Co (65.) Father Tuck's Annual. Christmas without Father luck's An- nual would be, to use an old simile, some- thing like the play of \" Hamlet\" minus the Prince of Denmark. The voting folk hail its appearance each year with rap- turous joy, and even the \"grown-ups\" may be found taking a surreptitious peep within its gay covers to see what fresh de- lights tho genial Father Tuck has been preparing for *his numerous family. This year\u2014the eleventh qf publication\u2014the An- nual is, if possib'e, bigger, brighter, and better than ever. It is edited as before by Edric Vredenburg, who, with his happy knack of knowing just what children like best, has filled its pages so well that there is not a single dull one among the 256 which make up the book. And how could there be, with such writers as E. Nesbit, G. Manville Fenn, and Norman Gale, and such artists as Louis Wain, Hilda Cow- ham, M. and A. L. Bowley, and all the other clever contributors? A Merry Christmas is assured to every bov and girl whose presents iifHude a copy of \" Father Tuck's Annual.\" From the same firm (Raphael. Tuck, <fc Sons, Ltd.) comes also a splendid assortment of toy and gift books of every description, all charmingly illustrated.

Wonder Books. Two volumes of Chambers' Wonder Books that lie before us\u2014\" Volcanoes and Earthquakes,\" by Professor E. S. Hous- ton, and \"Electricity for Young People,\" by Tudor Jenks\u2014suggest how easy is the path to knowledge in these en'ightened days. Beginning with a fine description of the great eruption of Krakatoa, Pro- fessor Houston goes on to deal with the tremendous manifestation of the forces of Nature in the volcanic areas all over the j world. Only towards the close of the book dees he deal with the causes of earth- quakes, and after reading the story of the great eruption the young student is !<*d naturally to seek for the root of the matter. In \"Electricity for Young People,\" Tudor Jenks has an entrancing story to tell\u2014the story of electricity from I the discovery of electricity from the bit j of rubber amber to the latest discoveries \\ in the rea,'m of this mighty force. In j simple language he traces the progress oF ! the science, and any boy with a bent to- j wards electricity who numbers this boofc j among his Christmas presents will have \u00bb happy time indeed. The volumes, both of which contain numerous illustration*, are published at 3s 6d by Messrs Cham- bers, of London and Edinburgh. Children and Gardens. The name of Miss Gertrude Jekyll is a familiar one to all lovers of gardens and gardening literature, and it} may be safely said that even those who have long passed their childhood's years will read with pleasure and profit her latest work, A PRIMROSE BALL. Children and Gardens,\" although it is written primarily for children. Much, however, as \"\u2022grown-ups\" will enjoy its peiusal, their pleasure will be small com- pared with tli at of the child who becomes the happy possessor of the work. To the girl or boy who is so fortunate as to re- ceive this as a Christmas gift the book will come as a. very mine of delight and information. Tt is prettily bound in pale green and gold, and is amply i'lustrated with more than a hundred photographs and line while the literary matter is just such as w ill be thoroughly enjoyed by youthful gardeners. It is not a mere manual of gardening instruction, but a volume of the most varied interest, from beginning to end. and in the intro- ductory chapter on \"My Own Young Days'' strikes a note which predominates throughout, and wMch will appeal to the young by its cheerful spirit and its sym- ' pathy with the thoughts and feelings of youth. The next chapter deals with children's gardens and play-houses, and here parents who wish to give pleasure to their young fo'ks will find much of profit to the latter in due course, should thev be willing to follow Miss Jekyll's advice,\"and provide their families with gardens and a playhouse in the garden. Even the youth- ful cook is considered, for not only are the plants for salads spoken of, but de- tails of the salad making are given, and directions for soups of various kinds pro- vided. In subsequent chapters such cog- nate subjects to the garden as weeds, seeds (with some appropriate illustra- tions), smells and shapes, botany, flowers for the chiMren's gardens, adventures on the lawn, and amusements are treated of, the whole concluding with a chapter on \"pussied,\" which will delight any child fond of the cat and its ways.-\u2014London : Countrv Life, Ltd.; George Newnea, Ltd.

Thibaudin, French Minister of War, who is believed to have abstained from being present at the reception of Alphonso on account of his Republican principles. The Paris correspondent of the Tunes says M. Ferry asserted his doe prerogative as Prime Minister by insisting on General Thibaudin's resignation. At a Cabinet Council the Ueneral's sham illness during King Alphonso's visit was sharply criticized, but he defended himself, complained that he had ail along been cold- shouldered by his colleagues, and declared his readiness to justify himself before the Chamber. After a confer- ence with several members of the Cabinet, M Ferry waited on the President to inform him that General Thibaudin's resignation was the only way of avoiding a Ministerial crisis, which just now wonld be very pre- judicial to foreign relations. The President reluctantly agreed to part with the Minister of War, and M. Ferry next called on the General to solicit his resignation. The Ueneral decliued to give this, unless at the express instance of the President, and he repaired to the Elyst e, where he found there was no help for it. Thereupon he drew up a letter of a resignation to the President.

The Htpubli-juc Franca it e declares that his maintenance in office would have rendered all regular relations with neighbouring countries impossible. The Paix would have preferred the step to have been taken less unexpectedly. The Oaului. says : \u2014\"General Thibaudin, as Minister of War, was dangerous to peace generally.\" The Voltaire denies that the Minister's resignation was owing to the demand uf Spain. The Irreconeileable journals violently attack the Ministry, and express the hope that General Thibaudin's retirement from the Cabinet will be of short duration. France.\u2014The final statistics uf the last census, just published, show that there were no fewer than 1,001,01)0 foreigners in France in 18H1\u2014 that is, 2 68 per cent, of tbe total population ot tbe country. Uf these 37,000 were English. The French Ministry of War lias been filled up by the appointment of General Catnpenon, who served under M. (jambetta as Minister of War. Madame Sarah Bernhardt'* unfortunate marriage is again exciting tbe curiosity of the scandal-loving Parisians. Two journals of second rate reputation a few \u2022lays ago driigged the subject out of oblivion on the plea of defending Madame Bernhardt's. husband, M. Dauiaia. !he defence of this gentleman, who has just accepted an engagement at the tiyutnasc Theatre, was coupled with tome not very complimentary remarks on the great sctiess and her seat. M. Maurice Bernhardt, a young man scarcely out of his teens, though precocious enough to be the lessee of a theatre, scut his seconds to the editors of tbe offending papers. Both declined to do battle with so young a man, but the result has been the publication of several enigmatical letters, which were never intended for publication, and an interview, in which Madame Bernhardt has explained iuiidelity and extravagance to be the cause of her separation from her husband. Egyit.\u2014The Soudan Expedition.\u2014The special correspondent of the Daily yew*, writing from the Entrenched Camp, 30 miles S.W. Dueui, Sept. 30, says before leaving Khartoum it was decided to establish a line of fortiticd posts in order lo maintain communication with our base on the Nile. In consequence of the (loveraor-General's report of the number of Arab tribes which return on our line of march after we pass, and the difficulty of inducing small bodies of troops to escort stores between the posts this plan has been abandoned. Consequently the anny is cut off from its base of opera- tions, and must depend for 60 days on biscuits and what san be captured hereafter. The army is advancing as rapidly as possible to Obeid in order to press on a decisive action, on which everything depend*. The heat is in- tense. The camels are daily dying iu considerable num- bers, but we hope to be able to carry all the biscuits to Die end; otherwise, ami if grain be not captured, retreat to tbe Nile would be necessary. The enemy, 12,000 strong, are reported to be close by. An official bulletin states that no death from cholera occurred throughout the whole of Egypt for three days. CAIRO, Oct. 9.\u2014lt is expected that the Khedive will ssae a decree on the occasion of the Courban Bahrain Festival a few days hence, granting an amnesty for all crimes connected with the late insurrection except mur- der and outrages on women. Turkey.\u2014Constantinople, October s.\u2014Lord Duff coin's audience with the Sultan yesterday was of a very cordial character. Nothing authentic has transpired in regard to what passed; but it is affirmed that the interview, which lasted nearly two hours, served to con- tribute to tbe consolidation of the friendly relations sub- liritiag between England and Turkey, and to guarantee the maintenance of peace. The British Ambassador addreased a Note yesterday to the Porte, asking to be enlightened with regard to the meaning of some expres- sions in the last Note of the Turkish Government on the subject of the commercial tariff, and requesting tbe Porte to make known what position British commerce would occupy during the interval which must elapse until the uew treaty comes into force. Lord Dufferin is said to have verbally declared that England accepts the 8 per cent, ad valorem Customs duty, but desires a declaration from the Porte that this duty will be permanent until the new tieaty is concluded. Switzerland.\u2014A public meeting was held at Neufcbatel on October 7, at which a resolution was adopted demanding the expulsion of tbe English members \u00bbf tbe Salvation Army. A Councillor of State who was \u00bbresent declared that tbe body to which he belonged vould do its duty and close the gates of Switzerland to hose who traded on her hospitality. The meeting, vhich was attended by 2000 persons, passed off in an trderly manner. The \"rabbit plague\" in Australia can stayed, it is proposed by Mr. Willows, M.8.C.V.5.1. inoculating some of the pests with tuberculous m:.. in the hope of driving them into a \" decline.\" A strange and fatal accident is reported from the Central Provinces of India. Doctor Jackson, civil surgeon of Pachmarree, while out tiger shooting with a friend waa attacked by hornets and received over 200 stings. Erysipelas set in and proved fatal. His friend was saved by tbe presence of mind of his servant, who dragged him into the jnngle, but not before he had been atung severely. In his case, however, no evil conse- quences followed. Advices received at Plymouth from Yoko- hama, dated August 28, announce that a lire, resulting in great loss of life, occurred in a theatre at Katamoto- inura Kamuda, Govi Sonuki. The building was filled with people during a performance, and being of highly inflammable construction the fhuues spread with awful rapidity, and in a few minutes enveloped the theatre. In an instant after the alarm there was confusion, and desperate attempts were made to get out of the theatre. In tbe result 15 adults and 60 children were found to have been killed, and over 100 persons were seriously injured. French Ayyressiamon the Congo.\u2014lntelligence from the Congo, brought to Madeira by the steamer Mandingo, reports that the French have taken possession A El Obey Point, where they are establishing factories and distributing flags to the natives. Tbe situation is regarded as very unsatisfactory by the resident traders, who fear that they will be driven- away. It is added that the French commandant at Gaboon is pursuing a course of action which apparently aims at the expulsion of the English and Gorman traders. Tbe French contem- plate establishing a factory at Old Calabar, and have had a grand palaver with the King, who is In their favour. The Volcanic Eruption in Java.\u2014Lloyd's agent at Batavia says tbe island of Krakatau, the summit of which peak was 1800 feet above water level, has totally disappeared below the sea, and the neighbouring island of Dwaisindetoag is split in five parts. Sixteen new volcanic islands have bean formed between Krakatau and Gibesie, and the aea bottom in the Straits of Sunda baa completely changed; in fart, the Admiral Commanding- in-Chief has issued a circular stating that till soundings have been taken the navigation of the Straits of Sunda is likely to be uti\u2014ily dangerous. Anger and lighthouse and the other lights of South-weat Java have all been destroyed. Tbe sabeWlences and upheavals we have alluded to caused a knee wane, about 100 Cart in height, to sweep down on the south-west ooast of Java and aooth of Sumatra. This wave swept inland for a great dlstaw\u00dfi, thereby doing great injury both to life and to property. According to the latest taUgrama from Sevang we learn that on tbe reoedenoe of Zirengen 10,000 livee art calculated to be lort.

The difficult question is to tell where it originated. Is it from one of the known volcanoes or from an eruption in some out of the way part of the world which has passed so far un- recorded? In 1883 the greatest eruption of modern times took place when the volcano of Krakatoa, in the Strait of Sunda, blew up, shattering the island and overwhelming over 36,000 people. The whole world was made aware of this catastrophe through the agency of dust. Vast quantities of it were flung into the upper atmosphere, and continued to float there for over three years, during which the fine dust cloud circled the whole world. In Scotland it produced during the whole of the three years the most remarkable series of sunsets ever witnessed. Krakatoa became active again in January last, and the Lemberg savants think that possibly it .is the source of the dust now falling in Poland. But the recent eruptions have not been on the catastrophic scale of that of 1883, and it is doubtful if anything less could produce so far- flung an effect. The fall is, however, another fact to add to the many all pointing to the present as an era of remarkable sub- terranean activity.", "id_issue": "0000564_19280502", "id_newspaper": "0000564", "page": "0006", "title": "FAR FLUNG DUST."}], "1934-10-13": [{"content": "COTSWOLD ROCKERY STONE CRAZY PAVING EDGING TURF LOAM MANURE SAND LIME CEMENT MAD If WILLIAMS \u25a0\u25a0I Hil\u00df PROMENADE CHELTENHAM CHIPPINGS GRAVEL COAL COKE ANTHRACITE FIREWOOD Phone 8779.

The latest information is contained in this message, re- ceived last night from Rangoon :\u2014\" Reports have been received this morning that the search continued all round the British steamer Clan Macmillan's last reported position. 1 here are still no signs of the steamer or the boats. Presum- ably the steamer sank or was abandoned, as nothing has been heard from her since 9.15 a.m. on Saturday.\" Clan Line officials, however, refuse to abandon hope. 1 here is nothing in the messages we have received to cause us to despair of the safety of the passengers and crew,\" said the London Manager. \"It may be ten days before the search ships get into touch. The currents about that part of the Indian Ocean are very strong, and might carry her a long- way out of her course.\" A Treacherous Bay In giving his reasons for refusing already J to abandon hope of the safety of the crew ! and vessel the manager pointed out that the company had received no further informa- tion than that sent from Lloyd's. But he contended that that information, so far as it went, contained nothing which was in- compatible with the safety of the passengers and crew. For that reason it was thought proper that the names of the passengers and crew should be published at present. Experienced Commander. \" If we do so it will look as though we fear they had been lost, and that is not the case. It would only cause unnecessary un- easiness and sorrow to relatives and friends in this country. \" Captain M'Kinnon, who is in command, is one of the best and most experienced commanders, and he may be trusted to do everything possible under the circumstances. \" Therefore we think it would be a great mistako to assume, from the information wo already possess, that all on board are lost. The fact of her signalling for assistance would indicate that she is not under con- trol, and Consequently she may have drifted a lone wny from the spot whence her wire- less message was despatched. \" It may be some hours, and even days, before the ships who are looking for her get into touch with her. The currents about that part of the Indian Ocean are very strong, and might carry lier a long way out of her course. \" The Clan Maomillan was on a vovage from Calcutta to the island of New Cale- donia, in the Pacific. As near as we can tell, the place from which she sent her wire- less message was about 1?4 degrees north latitude, just east of the Andaman Islands. \" Although it is the season for the mon- soon, there is reason to think that the islands would shelter tho ship from its full force.\" May Be Due to Eruption. The suggestion made at Lloyd's is that the loss of the Clan Macmillan may be due to volcanic eruption in the sea. In that region there are many instances of volcanic activity. Only as recently as January in the present vear a new island rose from the sea in the feav of Bengal, off the Akvab coast, to a height of 30 feet. After tbree months it disappeared again, leaving a dangerous shoal. Last July two new islands made their ap- pearance in the China Sea. and 40 vears ago there was the terrible outburst of volcanic activity which led to the destruction of the island of Krakatoa. THE LINER'S LAST MESSAGE. The history of the dan Macmillan's last reported movements opens with the follow- ing message from Rangoon:\u2014 \" The Bibby liner Leicestershire reports that she received a wireless message from the steamer Clan Macmillan. stating that the vessel was sinking off Table Island, in the Bay_ of Bengal, and that the crew were abandoning ship. \" On proceeding to the spot the Leicester- shire was unable to find any trace of the vessel or the crew, and it is feared that the latter have all been lost. It is presumed that the vessel foundered during a cyclone.\" A later message from Rangoon, however, brought the reassuring news:\u2014 \" Leicestershire has sent a wireless mes- sage stating ahe ha 3 just sighted the Clan Macmillan's boats.\" The news received la\u00bbt night, however, suggests that some misunderstanding must have arisen, as the Leicestershire up to that time was still without sight or sign of the missing vessel or crew. Tht Crew. \u00bb The Clan Macmillan was a vessel of 66C8 tons, owned by the Clan Line, Cayzer, Irvine, & Co., Ltd., Glasgow, and was built at Sunderland in 1918. She was bound from the Clyde, Liverpool, and Calcutta for Nukualoja, in the Friendly Islands. The crew of the Clan Mpcmillan would consist of roughly five officers, five engi- neers, one steward, and one carpenter, all white men, and about seventy Lascars. It is not known if there were passengers aboard. THE RESCUE SHIP. Leicestershire's Genial Officers. By a \" Couri\u00abr \" Staff Man. The nineteen passengers who left the Bibby liner Leicestershire at Marseilles on her voyage east would, like myself, get a thrill on Saturday evening when the news appeared that tlu\u00bb Clan Maemillan had sunk, and that tho Leicestershire was searching for her boats with the survivors. Wo were a merry party that left Liverpool on May 23. although but a few hours pro- viously we were strangers to each other. On our first morning at sea we were ordered to appear in the drawing-room at ten with lifebelts on, and were then instructed to procced to our various lifeboats. Soon the captain appeared with his list, and satisfied himself that we were at our correct boats. To most of us it was amusing while it lasted. Photographs were taken, and jokes about \" S.O.S \" wcro passed, but I believe that many of us at the back of our minds won- dered whether on a fine ship like the Leicestershire we would need to hurry to these same lifeboats at sonu\u00bb unearthly h\u00abur The news therefore that the ship is taking a prominent part in a rescue in the Bay of Bengal will remind in stern fashion the well-meaning humorists of the party what a stern taskmaster th* sra is The survivors will find the officer* and crew of the Leicestershire a fine lot of men. The commander is Captain P. de Legh, a genial skipper, who can find time occasion- ally to piny nn extra good game of skittles.

France & Ma dag a scar.\u2014Rekmseof Mr. Shaw. \u2014A telegram has been received' in Pkris from Admiral Pierre at the Ministry of Marine announcing that the proceedings against Mr. Shaw, the missionary, have resulted in a decision that there was no ground for the charges against him The telepsam adds thftt Mr. Shaw has been set at liberty on the island of Edna ion. It is, sf course, physically impossible, that the release oi Mr. fihaw should have had any connection with the new temper of conciliation\u2014if, indeed, it be new\u2014on the fart of the French Ministry. It is due to the itufeptfi- ilent action of the French authorities on the spot, who, having found out that ha\u00dfte or prejudfeo had lefd them to commit an injustice, have hail tho coorage atid good sense to confess their mistake instead Of attempting to excuse it. The result only shows how foolish it would have been for Englishmen to lash themselves into a fury which might have rendered it difficult for the French to \u00abake without lots of dignity such amends as they ean sow have no scruples about offering. France.\u2014The Civil Tribunal of the Seine has given judgment in the proceedings respecting the Siemoirs of the Comte de Viel Castel. The Comte was well known in the salons of the Second Empire, and a man about town, who seems to have kept a diary of all the obscene stories and scandal of the time, lie had been early separated from his wifo, and late in life bad contracted a liaison with a Mine, de G\u00absrard, to whom, according to her account, he gave the manuscripts, as his sole worldly possessions, at flie time of his death. Mine, fle Gerard has borne him two children, add it was to support them that he made the manuscripts over to her. Mme. de Odrard, after the Cerate's death, entered into negotiations v;ith the Viel Castel family, with a view to selling the papers to them, but terms couldnot be arranged, and ultimately Mme. de Gerard, with funds supplied by a Mme. Dnrand, had the book printed in Switzerland. It was brought out with a great deal of advertising, in Which the sole merit claimed for it was that it wae indecent. A Specimen catalogue of contents was sent far arid wide, which represented the book as treating of the am on re of the different notabilities, male and female, of the Im- perial Court. The family was shocked, ami the trustee sf the Comte's son (who has since died), on the ground that Mme. de Gerard had no right to the manuscript, had *n the copies found in France seized. The present action was brought by Mme. de Gerard to hate the seizure annulled. The plaintiff*! contended that it had not been effected with the necessary formalities, and that with respect to the alleged right Of the administrator to the property In the manuscripts, it was incumbent on him to prove his claim. In reply, counsel for the defendant produced a copv of a letter written by the Conite to hift son, recommending to his care his two illegitimate chil- dren. This letter never reached the son, and only an \u00bbxtract was communicated to him through the medium of a friend of his father. According to the friend, tbe pas- Mge omitted referred to the manuscript, and bequeathed it to the son. Counsel also produced ottier letters indica- tive of the Comte's intentions. The Court decided in favour of the defendant \u2014that Is to say, it declares the administrator of the Cctotc de Viel Castel's property to hate been entitled to hate the memoirs seized. It should be added that tbe truth of some of the storivs in the book has been tehemently disputed. Death of the CfoMc <ic Chambord.\u2014llertri, I)uc de Bordeaux, Comte de Chambord, ceased to breathe on Friday last. The agony of death set in on the previous afternoon. At noon the physicians bad announced to the family that dissolution was imminent. Thereupon all the members of the family assembled in the apartment adjoining the sick rOom. Here they spent some long and antlous hours. Towards midnfght, When the patient feD into an apparently tranquil sleep, most of the watchers retired to rest. At 4 o'clock in the morning they were again summoned. It Was thought that the last moment bad arrived, but the' struggle was not yet over. At about 8 o'clock spasms set in, and soon after- wurds death ensued. In the ehamber of death were the Countess, Gomt Bardi, tbe physician, Dr. Mayer, and tbe Father Confessor, Dr. Paul. In the next apartment were the other members of the household and the gentle- men who had oome from France. Tbe Comtesse de Ghaabord fainted when Dr. Mayer announced that MousiegnMr had passed away. At the last moment the Father Confessor grasped the left hand of the dying man and exclaimed \"Montez au Ciel, flls de St. Louis!\" Count Bardl, at the nearest relative, closed the eyes of Hie deceased. Immediately after death had enMKd tbe gentlemen ml aertante were admitted into the ehamber to kiss the hand of tbe Comte. The Comtetse Withdrew into her apartments and remained there all day. The fatal event was immediately announced to fee authorities at Vienna. About a hundred telegrams which had been prepared were sent with the tidings of death in aH direc- tions. Tbe Chamberlain of the Castle, M. de Pavilion, repaired to Vienna to confer with the Mai*ha! of tbe Imperial Household as to tbe interment, lit Giirite, where the body is to be interred, in tbe Vault of Cbaries X., great pomp will be observed on the occa- sion of the funeral. When the passing-bell Wat) tolled and the monnifnl intelligence became known, the inhabi- tants of Frohsdorf and the neighbouring villages tHronged to the castle to offer tip prayer* to the cbaprt for the ioul of the lost patron, to Whese mUnificenoe they owed to many benefits. Tbe Comte de Chatabord'a death had been too long foreseen to create any great sensation in Paris. His friends bad for weeks been prepared for the blow, and in some menmire resigned to its whilst his poli- tical adversaries\u2014personal enemies he had none\u2014bad bad ample rime to forecast the consequences. While, therefore, tributes of rtspevt to Ms mbfliory art universal \u2014and ah nhpoptflW has rtever had a Ifeade* so far beyond tbe reach of calumny\u2014people are more disposed to speculate on tbe future than to review the past.: That fnture, however, is at pwrailt veiled in much otakurity. au that is <*sat is that Legitimacy is at amend, tod that the indue Ftt# disappears fat eter. The Ganltr;*, indeed, raises the cry, \" ViVe Philippe VIL!\" But the (*auloi\u00bb, though it happens at present to be Legitimist, is not a recognized mouthpiece of the party. The CMmettc 4e Framee, a mure authoritative organ, <ftes not go beyond tbe expression \u00abt a bdpe that life &><Me de Fhris will uphold the Legitimist trwdKtolta; and cue Onion, the undoubted exponent of Legitimacy, reffairiS from saying a word on the new situation. The question it whether tbe Extreme Right will nrtly round a Prince who cannot help being the Hefcr of Louis Philippe as Ml as of Henri v. ; whether staunch Legitimfst* wni fight for a Prince who Is not a Legitimist, and Clericals for a Prince who Is not a Clerical. It is evident that these heated partisans are thrust into much the same position as tbe Bonapartists were by the death of the Prince Imperial. There is, it la true, the important difference that the Comte de Paris Is wholly exempt from the UUpepMatfcy which kttaehes to Prince Ifapoleou. But as a set-off to this, the Legitimists cannot, like the BoUapartists, ignore tbe immediate heir in favour of * reversioner. . The Count's father, the Dwe da Bern I, waa ansateinated as he was coming Osft \u00abf the Opefa4wUSe on Sunday tbe 19th of Fe\u00abMtiary, IWO, by one Louvel. TiM mother was a Princess of the two Sidife*, aud be was born on Michaelmas-day to the same year. As if to complete the sacred promise of his origin, he was baptised in Water brought from the river Jordan by Mm eloquent and once famous GhAtoanhriaad. Daring tbe Arab few years of the child's life Hie prospects off <he MUUariAt seemed secure.

T drew the Count to my Anns and long held him clasped to Ay heart. Hie tears we both pleniteously shed were balm to my soul and effaced the recollection of my past sorrows. My aodl welted over with the joy of a father finding again bis lost' dilldren. I could not keep my eyes from the Count and the Due de Chartres. I admired them ; 1 wat delighted with thetn; I felt that they were of my blood, and I took pride in them as if they were my sons. Our con- versation bad the abruptness, the freedom, the volubility of old friends meeting after a long absence, whose hearts gd out to each other. The tortures of exile, the bitter- ness of life were forgotten. -'They\u2014these two young men\u2014were to mo my country, my family, my future. We laughed and chatted unreservedly and with cordial gaiety. Madame jested with the Prince de Jofnrille on their common infirmity of deafness. What a lot, to be sure, of castles in the air we all merrily built that even- ing.\" The expectations indulged in by the Royalists were destined to disappointment. When the supreme moment came the Count refused to gite up his white flag, and the one great opportunity of Ids life was lost. The personal appearace of the deceased Pretender was prepossessing. His head was very well shaped. He was about the middle height and rather stout. His face was remarkably intelligent and denoted much energy of character. His eye was a clear blue-ahd his gaze very earnest; but what struck one particularly was his emphatic tone when speaking. The substance of the C6mte de Chambord'S Will was published on July 11 by a Boyalist' newspaper in Paris. According to it the Comte de Chambord formally commanded the obedience of the Royalists to the Comte de Paris as the heir to the throne of France, aild bequeathed to bim his library, his artistic collections, and all the papers interesting to the House of France.\u2014The Republican journals comment in respectful terms upon the death of the Comte de Cham- bord, and declare that with him disappears the doctrine of Divine right. The RApublique Frattfdite says that under present circumstances the death of the Count is not a political event. The Jeurnnl des Debate considers that the event will not shake the Republican system of government, Which has been accepted l>y the immense majority of the country. The Monarchical journals believe tltat the sincere and complete unity of the Royalist party is now assured. \u2014The will of the late Comte de Chambord bequeaths a legacy of considerable amount to the Pope. It is understood that the Countess will enter a convent. The Pope has sent a telegraphic despatch to Frohsdorf expressing condolence. Hie Princes of Orleans, with their suites, numbering 20 in all, arrived at Frohsdoif on Tuesday. All the visitors were asked to leave the mortuary chamber. Then, amid general silence, appeared at the open doorway the tell form of the Cointe de Paris, with his sOns, followed by the Due de Nemours, the Prince de Joinville, and the Due d'Alencon. The Comte de Paris stood still for a moment, glanced at the corpse, tlien passing his hand slowly over his brow walked to the praying stools. All knelt in deep emotion for some minutes. Then the Comte de Paris took his sons and went to the bedside, and knelt with them for some time. On rising he sprinkled the body with holy water. When all five hHd done the same they retired, walking backwards. Sooth Africa.\u2014Durban, Aug. 23 (Times). \u2014It is now certain that Cetewayo, in a defiant spirit, is gathering round him in the Inhanhla bush, eight miles beyond the Middle Drift of the Tugela, a constantly growing forcc of armed followers. The situation of Natal, should Cetewayo cross the border with his army, an a refugee or otherwise, is not likely to be a pleasant one. The Natal Caffres on this side of the drift are sftid to sympathise with Cetewayo. For the protection of the border 500 men of the 41st Regiment have been ordered to the lower Tugela. Two companies, ft is thought, may be despatched to Oreytown. It is suggested that Cetewayo may represent that these troops are advancing to support him. Most well informed persons here lrt'ld that the quickest and mofet effective solution of the existing difficulty would be for the Crown to declare its authority absolute as far as Urnvolosi, and to act accord- ingly. It is, of course, impossible to foresee what effect any sudden movement of Cetewayo might have. It is rumoured that more fighting ban occurred in North Zululand.

I'p to last night, how- ever, the Government hail received no intelligence confirming this statement. The latest news received at the Foreign office is that the Arneer Was about to leave the camp Mama Kheyl for Cabul, after having given a cordial reception to Khan Bajom arid some Orukzai chiefs from Herat. A correspondent at Lahore tele- graphs this morning that it is reported the Ameer left Mama Kheyl for Cabul oh Thursday last, and that the rumours as to his assassination probably arose from the discovery of some plot laid, but not executed.

A nti-Jewish Riots in Hungary.\u2014Perth, Aug. 27.\u2014Anti-Jewish riots commenced at Zala Egersseg, in Western Hungary, on the 23d inst., and continued with increasing violence on the 24th and 25th Inst, after the rioters had been reinforced by a number of peasants from the neighbourhood armed with muskets. The mili- tary were compelled to intervene, and a serious conflict ensued between them and the rioters, in which there were several killed and wounded on both sides. The destruction of property is described as terrible. Yester- day a number of peasants living at Zala Egersseg and in the neighbourhood are reported to have again attacked the military and the Jews. Twenty soldiers are said to have been killed and wouuded in the fighting. Anti- .Tewish disturbances have also occurred at Cszurgo Kesztliely and Gros Kamizsa. At the latter place, how- ever, the police, assisted by a detachment of Dragoons, succeeded in dispersing the mob.

Death of the Queen of Madagascar.\u2014A tele- gram has been received at the London Missionary So- ciety's House which states that the Queen of Madagascar died on the 13th July. Order and quiet prevail in tbe capital and central provinces. Queen Ranavolana 11. succeeded to the throne of Madagascar on tbe death of Queen Rasoaherina on April 1,1868. As she was known to be in favour of progress, her accession was generally bailed with satisfaction. After she had been elected Queen she adopted the Christian religion. The late Queen, while her deceased predecessor was lying in State, read portions of an old Bible, which for some time Was kept on a table in the palace, and from the perusal of that book the Qticen decided to embrace the faith for which many distinguished people of her conntry had suffered loss of life. LONDON and PROVINCIAL. The Queen, accompanied by Princess Bea- trice, Princess Christian, Pr.'nces Christian and Albert of Sehleswig-Holstein, and Princess Alice of Albany left Osborne on Priday evening for Scotland. The Royal train reached Ballater, the railway terminus, at half-past two on Saturday afternoon. A large crowd had collected to welcome the Queen. Her Majesty seemed to be in excellent health and spirits, and bowed her acknow- ledgments to the people, who cheered and waved their hats as she entered her carriage. The Queen, on her arrival at Balmoral, drove to Crathie churchyard, and remained a long time at the grave of John Drown. Mr. Joseph Devereux, Mayor of Windsor, and Mr. Robert Rawlinson, C.8., Chief Engineering Inspector of the Local Ciovernment Board, have received the honour of knighthood. Mr. Alderman Hadley, who is the next Alderman \" below tbe chair\" has expressed his willing- ness to serve the office of Lord Mayor next year should the lively elect him at Michaelmas and the Court of Aldermen ratify tbe choice. During the session 180 private Bills received the Royal assent. The total number of private Bins introduced or brought from the Lords was 2(55, but 85, for various reasons, did not reach their final stage. Only 14 were thrown out because the preamble was not proved. In the session just concluded there were 314 divisions ; 65 of them were taken on the Corrupt Prac- tices Bill, 30 on the Agricultural Holdings Bill, 8 arose out of the Bradlaugh business, and of tbe remainder 48 were taken in Supply. Whilst the Ministerial programme for next session is of course not yet settled in detail, the Daily Mews has reason to believe that the County Fi&nchise Bill will occupy a prominent and early place in it. The Observer says that the impression is gaining ground that the Cabinet look forward to a disso- lution of Parliament in the autumn of next year. The Ministerial programme for next session will be specially framed with % view to this contingency. The Lord Chancellor lias reported to the House of Lords that the claim of Lord Malahide to vote at the election of representative Peers for Ireland has been established to his satisfaction. The Hon. C. H. Strutt, Conservative, was returned, without opposition, on Saturday, for Kast Essex, in the room of Colonel Brise, resigned. Mr. Gladstone received a very enthusiastic Welcome at Chester on Saturday nigbt on bis arrival from London. Cheer after cheer Was given in obedience to demands of persons in the large crowd. Mr.Gladstone remained bareheaded while he acknowledged the salutes. On Sunday the Premier read tbe lessons at Hawarden church. The right hon, gentleman is carefully guarded by members of the Flintshire constabulary. Some of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act which received the Royal assent on Saturday will come at once into operation, although the main body of the Act does not take effect until the new year. Thus, for the future no composition or liquidation under the Bankruptcy Act of 1809 will be allowed without leate, and this will only be granted when tbe Court thinks it reasonable and for the benefit of tho creditors generally. It was the subject of general conversation before the adjournment (the Morning Advertiser says) among members of her Majesty's Opposition that Sir Stafford Northcote, acting upon impeintite instructions from his medical adtisers, has reluctantly determined to abstain from active participation to future Parliamentary debate, and there appears every probability, in tho opinion of the right hon. gentleman's political friends, that he Will retire from the leadership of his party in the Representative Chamber before the commencement of the next session. The Home Secretary told a deputation who complained to bim on the 83d inst. of the closing of certain London parks against public meetings that his sympathies were entirely With them, that it was absurd for the Metropolitan Board of Works to prohibit what was permitted in parks under the control of the Crown, and that it was n\u00aboeosatfy that the people of Loudon should hate places throughout tho metropolis where meetings could be held and public discussions conducted to an orderly manner. Mm. Winch Winchcoittb has died at Wrays- bury, in Buckinghamshire, hating a few days pretiously attained the age of 100. Mr. Hy.

Since her husband's death Mrs. Love has given away 50,000/. to religious and philanthropic objects, the Methodist Hew Connexion, of which both deceased and her husband were members, being tbe chief recipients. The Rev. C. H. Spurgeon on Sal rntion Armies. \u2014 Mr. Spurgeon, in fftcord and Trovel, writes:\u2014lf you want to know bow to dhdraot a congregation, you hate only to go \u00abo the great dram-thumping establishments, and hear for yourself how noise can be glorified. Out- side of these emporiums instruments of brass an to fuH blast, with their still small voicee proclaiming peace on earth, goodwill toward men. To put it more plainly, the age of tbe tin kettle and the banjo has arrited, and with these weapons of our warfare the strongholds of evil are to be thrown down. In certain districts the Sabbath is made hideous, the streets are rendered dangeroas, and quiet is banished, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and with tbe view of attracting the masses to Him. The design is admirable, the method in- tolerable. Conservative Gatherbig at Wakejield. \u2014A Con- servative demonstration was held at Nostell Priory, the sent of Mr. Rowland Winh, M.P., near Wakefield, on Urn 83d. tar Miohael Hicks-Beach, addressing the meeting, referred to tbe legislation of the seesion, and said ' Many of the measures recommended by the Prime Minister bad disappeared altogether from the attention of the country; and why ? Because the cuantij never really wanted them. Some few, and Bdt the least important by any means, had passed into law at the instance of the Conservative party; hut how had legislation been conducted, and especially during the \u25a0msion just abont to close?

There was only some bread in the house, and his fkther threatened to take her life for keeping him without better food. About 8 o'clock his mother went home and hb father again threatened her. She after- wards got tip And dressed herself and went to the gate. While she was standing there the next door neighbour called her. When tfhe came back she said to her husband, \"1 can't sleep a minute for your slang.\" It was a woman named Poster who called her. She said, \" Mm. Cole, I want to speak to you,\" and his mother went and spoke to her at the gate. All of a sudden His mother ran back to her own house, at the gate of which witness waa standing. When his mother opened the door Witness Aw his father holding the deceased up by the feet and k&ockfng his head on tbe floor. He then threw the child over his shoulder and dropped it on the floor. His mother seized his father by the collar just as he was about to take up his little sister. When his mother first rushed in she saw what her husband was about to do with Tommy, and screamed out \" Murder f and \" Oh! he's miing my child.\" After that his mother seized the deceased and placed him on the bed.\u2014 Robert Gilbert, of 1, Pridham-road West, deposed that at he was going home on Sunday night the 19th he heard cries of \"Murder!\" He rushed to Cole's house and saw the accused dash tbe deceased against tbe wall of the front room. Witness pulled him out of the house and handed him over to a constable.\u2014Harriett Harding, a married woman, living at 11, Pridham-road West, Mid that on the night in question she was standing at her door, when die heard Cole using filthy language towards Us wife. By the Coroner: Cole Was of tatompentte habits. When he was sober he would stay indoor* all the week and not search for work. She did not tiwnk the accused had had anything to drink on Sunday. She knew he had been in prison many times, and that be was a very desperate man. On one occasion his trite jumped out of a first-floor window to assaps from mm While he was chasing her with a knife.\u2014Tbe jury returned a verdict of \"wilful murder\" against James Cole.

The Assanxiiuitwn of Carey.\u2014Messrs. Donald Carrie and Co.'s steamer Norham Castle arrived in Plymouth Sound on Sunday evening, and brings the con- tinuation of the evidence given before the Natal Magis- trates, when O'Donnell was charged with the murder of James Carey.\u2014Mrs. Carey, who looked greatly distressed, said that she was the wife of the deceased James Carey, and came out in the Kinfanns Castle with her husband and seven children. She knew the prisoner O'Donnell, who came from London in the same mat. They used to speak to each other. O'Donnell landed in Cape Town with them. Her husband was the man who gave tho evidence in the Irish trials. She left London by herself, and her husband met her at Dartmouth. She had never seen O'Donnell before, and her husband and O'Donnell never talked together aliout the trials. They were steer- age passengers, and O'Donnell was second class. Worm- in gt on, a detective in Dublin, put the name \" Power \" on their boxes to avoid detection. She did not know who paid their passage money. Witness went on to say that she recollected Sunday, July 29, when she sawher husband running toward her, saying, \" Maggie, I am shot, and O'Donnell shot me.\" Witness asked prisoner who shot him, and prisoner replied, \" I shot him; I was sent to do it.\" Prisoner said, \"Your name is not Power; it is Carey.\" Mrs. O'Donnell said to her husband, \" You are no Informer, O'Donnell.\" Witness did not shake hands with O'Donnell. The prisoner was sitting on the seat. O'Donnell during the day had asked witness, previous to the murder, where her husband was, when she replied, \"On deck,\" when prisoner said, \" Call him down.\" Witness did so, and the prisoner and deceased had some beer together. O'Donnell and her husband used to play dice on deck. The passage out took 21 days, and during that time O'Donnell and her husband were on the best OT terms. Prisoner bad told her that he had left the ship in Cape Town. O'Donnell was jealous of Carey, as ht had been too attentive to his wife on the Sunday after- noon. On Sunday she left deceased ami O'Donnell together. Deceased was standing and O'Donnell and hit wife were sitting on the settee together. She did not see the first shot Sred, but heard the third. She did not heai any strong words pass between them, and never heard hei husband threaten to shoot O'Donnell. Afterwards ah* fainted and was put into a cabin. Slie had no money and did not know what she would do. She supposed her hus- band would have looked for employment. Mrs. Carey, who had conducts 1 herself in a most becoming manner, and for whom evident sympathy was manifested in court, having signed her depositions, left the court.\u2014llan-y tireenhough said he was a second-class passenger on board the Melrose for Natal. On the Sunday afternoon he was on deck between 1 and half-past and heard O'Donnell say, \"He shall not leave the ship.\" He was not certain whether he said \"he \" or \" she.\" The deceased and th\u00ab prisoner were on the be>t of terms.\u2014Thomas Francis Carey, an intelligent-looking lad, said : I am 15 years of age. When my father was shot I was on the stairs lead- ing to the second-class saloon. I saw my father standing near one of the cabins on the starboard side. He was smiling and talking with O'Donnell. I saw Mr. O'Donneil draw a revolver from his inside pocket and tire one shoi at my father. The bullet struck him in the neck. I can- not say whether the prisoner stood up, but I saw him fir* a second shot. Just at this moment my mother ran out. My father ran into my mother's arms and cried out, \" Maggie, Maggie, I am shot. M'Donald has shot me.' We used to call O'Doiwell M'Donald ou board ship. Mj mother was holding my father when the third shot was fired. I was standing near the berths at the time. I took from my father's pocket a cheque for 1001. It was drawn on the South African Bank at Natal. I found the cheque this morning. I gave the cheque to my mother this morning. She knew nothing of it until then. My mothei can neither read nor write. Mr. Dallmont, chief detectivc in Dublin, gave the cheque to my father.\u2014The prisonei pleaded not guilty, and said that be acted in self-defence, as Carey pulled a revolver out of his right hand pocket. \u2014The prisoner was then taken from the dock, and after a short interview with his agent was conveyed to the North-end gaol.\u2014O'Donnell arrived at Capetown on Sun- day morning in the Athenian. He was to leave on Tuesday evening. His friends are supplying him with everything he wants to eat and drink.\u2014Mrs. Carey will leave with the other witnesses in a few days. She will, it is believed, give important evidence hitherto withheld from fear of the consequences to .her late husband.\u2014At a meeting ol the Irish-Americans held at Nashville on Monday a large sum of money was collected for the defence of O'Donnell.", "id_issue": "0000237_18830831", "id_newspaper": "0000237", "page": "0003", "title": "General News of the Week."}, {"content": "IMMENSE DESTRUCTION.

EFFECT OF WEST INDIES VOLCANIC ERUPTION. \"No artist could transfer that to canvas.\" Such was the remark heard by the writer yesterday evening in the west end of Itun- dee, where a magnificent view could be obtained of the most gorgeous sunset of the season. The sky in yesterday's gloamin' was, in- deed, a picture of loveliness it were almost vain to attempt to describe. As the earth, rolling through space, gradually but surety sank towards the east, nearer and nearei the huge glowing ball of the setting sun, which on the south-eastern shore of England rose yesterday morning partially eclipsed, ap- proached our western horizon till at last the solar body was hidden from view by the Perthshire hills. Then a panorama of colour which, changing with each fleeting minute, trans- formed sky, river, and woodland into a picture of ethereal beauty. Nature seemed to bring all her arts into play to stride the beholder with admiration, awe, and rever- ence. We saw her in one of those soft moods which are only a&sociateu with an autumn twilight. No one possessing aesthetic or poetic instincts could gaze upon a scene of such grandeur and remain un- moved. Beside Nature in one ot these in- spiring moods, the greatest preacher, pamper, or poet must own his insignificance. When the sun had disappeared from view his rays were still reflected on the fleecy clouds that appeared above the western hori- zon. These clouds, in long curling masses, stretched almost half across the dome ot blue. Tinged first with a colour resembling ligat orange, they gradually assumed a aarker hue, and soon became a vermilion tint. At this moment the waters of the lay had changed from a dark green to assume the colour or heliotrope, and then, as if by magic, the sur- rounding hills gathered a similar tint. In is curious picture lingered for a few minutes till the same colour seemed to uplift itself to the clouds, and almost imperceptibly river and woodland again became dark green, A thin streak of azure on the horizon made a beautiful background to the panorama of darker colours on earth and cloudland, and till the last ray had exhausted its effulgence, and earth, river, and sky assumed the darkish grey of nightfall, the kaleidoscopic picture kept the beholder spellbound. Cause of the Beautiful Phenomenon. Those who saw the phenomenon and those less fortunate will be interested to learn that scientists ascribe 6uch sunsets as that of List night and those previously seen of late to be caused by volcanic upheavals. It is believed indeed that this strangely beautiful pheno- menon will serve to keep the volcanic horror of Martinique vividly before the minds of the people in all parts of the world for many months to come. As though to show her spectacular versa- tility, Nature has seized on the ugly black dust that Mont Pelee belched into the air and made of it, in combination with the sun, a gorgeous picture, on which the cur- tain rises morning and evening in various parts of the world. Effect of Mont Pelee Dust Cloud. WJierever this huge cloud of volcanio dust hovers the sun rises and sets with a ver- mihon-hued magnificence that attracts all eyes to the horizon. Taken individually, the sun is a mere sun, and the cloud of dust from Mont Pelee a most unbeautiful mantle of smoke. W hen Nature brings the two together in the upper air the spectacle compels admirers of the beautiful to cry, \"Glorious!\" The volcanic sunset can easily be distin- guished from the ordinary sinking of the orb at the close of a day. A peculiar scarlet-coloured splendour marks the going down of the sun behind the Mont Pelee dust cloud. The sky to the eastward is fiery red, with an odd, copper-colcured gleam about the edges of the mass of ver- milion and a rich, ruby glow where the cloud of dust is thickest. The dust is so light that it floats in the highest currents of the upper air. Professor C. L. Doolittle, of the astrono- mical department of the University of Pennsylvania, has been an interested ob- server of the phenomenon, which he com- pares with the\\weird beauty of the sunset glow following the great eruption of the volcano of Krakafcoa, in 1883. \" The beautiful display observed in cer- tain parts of the world at sunrise and sun- set,\" he says, \" will continue visible until the smoke of the Martinique disaster is en- tirely dissipated. A Previous Great Eruption. Gradually the dust thrown into the air bj the volcanic eruption will settle to earth again, carried down by the rain and natural causes. It will probably be several months at least before the dust cloud will have settled sufficiently to deprive us of the sun- set spectacle. \" The eruption at Krakatoa us superb sunsets for three years, the most beautiful being visible in England. I was then at Bethlehem, connected with the Lehigh University, and, as so vast a mass of dust had never been thrown into the air within the memory of living man, 1 made a point of studying closely the effect of the sun's rays upon it.\" \" If anyone would like to observe at close range the way Nature can make plain, black coal dust glow into life and beauty let him observe the effect of the sun's rays striking the edge of a smoke cloud hovering above the river these days of soft-coal consump- tion. The distance at which the same thing is seen during one of these volcanic-dust sun- sets lends enchantment to the view. \" Seen through a bank of volcanic dust, the blue and violet rays of the sun are ab- sorbed, so that the light comes mainly from the red end of the spectrum. \" The spectacle was visible in the morn- ing as well as at night, after the Krakatoa eruption, but there being fewer people about at dawn than at eve this feature of the phenomenon was lost sight of. \" The reason the sun and the dust cloud combine only at night and in the morning to give us the spectacle is that the intense red glow of the volcanic sunset is not pro- duced except when the rays of the sun Btrike the cloud horizontally. While the sun is overhead its rays easily penetrate the thin veil of dust, and its presence is not made known. \" When, however, the sun, rising or sink- ing, tries to pierce the cloud from its flank a struggle ensues, which results in the superb beauty of the sunsets that are now being seen as\" a reminder of the Mont Pelee disaster. \u2014- \"The constituents of the dust cloud are probably powdered pumice stone and lava. The particles are too fine to descend to earth in a hurry, and the great bank of smoke may wander around for a year or more with- out anyone being aware of its presence, ex- cept when the sun makes the fact known by giving us one of its wonderfully beautiful or by making Its wow in the morning in a blaze of scarlet glory.\"", "id_issue": "0000164_19021101", "id_newspaper": "0000164", "page": "0004", "title": "LOOK OUT FOR GRAND SUNSETS."}], "1930-06-27": [{"content": "4,500 Eduptions in One Day.

Ihe substance of Mr. Shaw's case, which he has for- warded to the Imperial Government, is that he was charged falsely with harbouring spies, and wa* impri- lened ashore. He was then taken on board the Nievre, ind charged with attempting to poison the French troops. Twenty-two days after the first charge was made he was charged with another offence. He was never tried by court-martial, but was periodically exa- mined on freshly trumped-up accusations. When finally released he was on the verge of starvation. Zulttland.\u2014Durban, Sept. 1 (Times). \u2014 About 400 men of the 41st Regiment, including mounted infantry, are now marching from Verulam to Stanger, 15 miles this side of the Lower Tugela. Their final destina- tion is kept secret. Colonel Montgomery is in command. Stanger is 50 miles from Middle Drift, beyond which is Inkankla Bush, the place of Cetewayo's refuge. In the absence of official tidings it is difficult to know what is actually going on. A private correspondent at Inkankla, writing on August 19, says that Mr.Osborne waited three days to see the King, when a letter was sent for Mr. Osborne. Cetewayo, however, fled into the bush when the Resident, with a small mounted escort, came in view of the kraal. As armed parties seemed to be gathering en the hill-tops around, Mr. Osborne deemed it prudent to return. The Ekowe Usutu partjr are rallying again in the relerve, it is reported, with a view of proceeding again against Usibepu. The latter is said to have killed Sotkele, a chief, near St. Lucia Bay, destroying and dispersing his tribe. Europeans in Zululand maintain that the only way to establish peace is an armed occupa- tion of the Reserve, whither Vmnyamana and Umlabuko are on their way to join the King. The Pietermaritzburg correspondent of the Daily News telegraphs:\u2014The followers of Onyanaa, the Prime Minister, are crossing into the reserve by ones and twos. This gives rise to the suspicion that the case of that chief is hopeless. Carnage and plunder continue. Hlubi has, under orders, mustered his fighting men. It is believed that a combined movement is to be made to disband the armed party with Cetewayo. Durban, Sept. 5 (Jleuter). \u2014Cetewayo, at the head of a strong force, is still in the Reserve territory. He maintains a defiant attitude towards Mr. Osborn, the British Resident, and declines all intervention of the colonial authorities. The Zulu King has summoned the Usutus to join him. Afghanistan.\u2014Calcutta, Sept. 2 ( Times). \u2014 It was rumoured here last week that the Important tribe of the Ghilzais had risen against the Ameer. There was no trnth in the report. The Ghilzais are doubtless dis- contented at the Ameer's having raised their tribute, snd held them responsible for the raid made recently on a caravan near Jagdalak. But Mag Mahomed Khan, one of their leading chiefs, has just waited on the Ameer at Mama-Khel; and Khan Mahomed Khan, another important chief, has started to try and recover the pro- perty for which the tribe is held answerable. Many other influential Ghilzais are with the Ameer. There have been disturbances among the Zurmat and Kullowaz, in which Mushk-i-Alim is believed to have been impli- aited ; but General Katab Khan, with a small force, easily quelled them, destroying many forts, among them that of Mushk-i-Alim.

Two villages have been entirely burned down. Fires break out simultaneously in several places, and never anywhere but in the houses of Jews. Enormous quantities of corn have been burns 1. The outrages have been carefully planned. They were to commence all at unce at the annual market of Egerczeg, but bands of young men out of work, who call themselves Hungarian Kihilists, hurried matters on. At Szentpeter on the night jf the 29th a merchant wait robbed and then murdered. 1 lie son of an old Jew whom masked men were murder- ing managed to save his mother and bis sisters by shoot- mg the aggressors, whose bodies the mob carried off. Hundreds of Jews fled to Kanissa, leaving their property behind. Some of the reports, however, must be received with caution. According to one, some houses were set \"ii tire, and the Jews thrown into the flames. In some 'uses respectable persons mingled with the plundarerg, and the next day returned all they could lay their hands <\u00abn to those who had been robbed.

His ship had a layer of ashes 18 inches thick on her deck. In some places masses of floating pumice-stone seven feet in depth were passed. In the district of Tjiringen the loss of life is estimated at 10,000. Some estimates place the total loss of life in the Straits through the eruption at over 30,000. \u25a0' < Probably no volcanic eruptions in the world have been physically so terrible as some of these In Java, though \u2022>'e Italian eruptions have brokon in more conspicuously on the art and civilisation of the world.

A telegmm from the DtiWy News corres- pondent at Teheran states that, according M reports from Kotchao,. the Bussian Commissariat is buying large quantities of provisions, and-storing them in plaees east of Askhabad. A camp has been formed there, and when the force numbers men it is believed that 10,000 will march, under General Camaroff, to Merv. It has been the singular fortune of the Royal Faintly of Denmark to ally itself in the preseflt> genera- tion with two of the peat Royal Houses of BUMpe and to giro a Sovereign M Greece. The occasions whtn the several members of a fhmfly so dispersed can meet together must necessarily be rare and are naturally wel-\u00ab come when they occur. The King of Greece with his Queen, the Princess of Wales, the Empress of Russia with her Imperial husband, the Duehesr of OmalMlind, the youngest daughter Of the King of Denmark, are now all assembled in a family gathering a* Copenhagen. A somewhat original irtyle of spending a honeymoon is reported from Russia. When Count Sbereinetieff the other day married the Countess Heyden, he hired the steamer Oleg, which is now taking them up the Volga. Hie Druslina Steamboat Company, to whom the steamer belongs, receives a payment of 30/. a day, in return for which sum the Count may travel how and where he likes. Numerous wedding guests accompany the Count and Countess Sbereinetieff ; and the party on board the Oleg includes a band, 20 singers, a photo- grapher, a physician, male and female cooks, bemdes a numerous staff of servants. A special despatch to the News from Lam- pasas, Texas, says. \"A carriage, containing the skeletons of three adults and two children, sitting bolt upright, SS if in life, under a large tree, has been found near a road in Llano County. The tree was shattered by lightning. It is supposed the carriage sought shelter under the tree and was struck, the bolt killing the inmates and the horses. The weather-beaten appearance of the carriage and its trimmings indicates that the event happened a year or two ago. In a small trunk was a letter addressed to 'James G. Chamberlain, London, England.' The parties are supposed to have been tourists. The spot where they were found is very secluded, and far from every habitation.\" A disastrous accident has occurred in the Swiss valley of Wessthall. A bridge crossing the WesS had just been built at Zell Kykon, and on Friday the first vehicles \u2014waggons with bales of cotton\u2014were being taken across it. The opening of the bridge was being celebrated with much rejoicing in the quiet locality, and local magnates were witnessing the inauguration. When, however, a very heavy weight of waggons was allowed to remain stationary for a minute or two in the very centre of the bridge, the structure was unable to support this excessive weight, and gave way. The horses and wag- gons were precipitated into the rapidly flowing river. Among others who were accompanying the waggons on this first passage over the new bridge were the Mayor of the township of Zell, who was killed, a French sub-con- tractor named Gominelle, who received injuries which must prove fatal, a member of the Zurich Council, who was terribly hurt, and a number of workmen, some of whom have lost their lives ; bnt the exact number of deaths has not yet been ascertained. A Curious Sentence. \u2014A curious sentence was passed recently by Judge Krekel, of the United States District Court in Missouri. An illiterate man having been convicted of a minor offence, he was ordered by the Judge to be detained ift gaol until he should be able to read and write ; and another offender, less ignorant, was sentenced to be similarly imprisoned until he should have instructed the former in those valuable arts. It is state ! that in three weeks the man reappeared able to write fairly well from dictation, and both pupil and master were discharged. A Fight with Brigand*.\u2014Our Naples corre- spondent writes : \u2014\" Accounts come from Cantanzaro of a severe conflict with a band of brigands. For some time it had been known that this band was disquieting the neighbourhood of the Sila in Cosenza (Calabria), and search had been made. On the 17th of last month the whereabouts of the brigands was ascertained, and two parties were sent to the place. On the 25th the brigands were overtaken, and a furious combat took place, lasting three hours. The chief of the band, Giovanni Ricca, was killed, and his father and cousin hurt, but they succeeded in escaping. Five of the attacking party were wounded, one dangerously.\" The Irish Leaders in America.\u2014The New York correspondent of the Daily News says the alarming rumours said to have reached England concerning the revival of the Irish conspiracy in America are received here incredulously. It is well known that Irish interest in the agitation is more stagnant than it has been for years. Instead of combining for fresh exertion, the Irish leaders are quarrelling among themselves. Rossa and his faction are denouncing McDermott as a spy in the pay of England, and declaring that he has no information of value to give. Rossa says to-day that the conspiracy will revive and keep reviving until the English are killed out of Ireland. John Devoy says Rossa was in league with McDermott to betray the Irish plans, and that his organization protects and encourages informers. It says: \"The blackguardism practised by Rossa, and sustained by Patrick Ford, is calculated to drive every self-respecting man out of the national movement, and make the name of Irish Revolutionist a byword and a term of contempt.\" Desperadoes in America.\u2014Twenty-five miles north of Hot Springs, Arkansas, is a wild, mountainous country, inhabited by desperadoes who have of late terrorised the people. On the 18th of April, a press despatch states, their career was begun by the cold- blooded murder of Wm. Potter, a well-to-do farmer and peaceable citizen, who was shot down while at work in his field without a word of warning. The men who com- mitted the deed were the two Daniels brothers and one Rial Blocker. Immediately Governor Berry took active measures to suppress the gang, and issued a proclamation offering 200 dols. reward each for their arrest. The des- peradoes established themselves in a strongly fortified gorge at the junction where Montgomery, Yell, and Gar- land counties corner, and continued their raids. A church building in the neighbourhood was sacked and burned to the ground. Later a respectable farmer, Manneo Baldwin, was called to his door at midnight and shot down in the presence of his wife. On one occasion the men went to a church meeting in Baxter township, Garland county, heavily armed with Winchester rifles, and interrupting the minister bade the congregation to remain quietly in their seats. The leader of the gang walked up to the pulpit, handed the minister a note, and commanded him to read it. The note warned certain members of the congregation that their efforts to sup- press the banditti would, if continued, lesult in their unconditional \"removal.\" The situation became more and more serious. Within the last few weeks measures were taken to bring matters to a crisis. Armed posses, accompanied by guides and bloodhounds, were started out to run down the outlaws. The pursuing parties were composed of resolute men who were fully aroused to the importance of their mission. One of the parties struck a due, and at once put bloodhounds at work. The fugitive outlaws were traced to one of their mountain fortifica- tions, and a fight ensued, in which two of the pursuing party were killed and one was shot seriously. The out- laws, after enticing the pursuers into a narrow gorge, ambushed them. Only four shots were fired by the desperadoes. The pursuers made a bold stand, but their incessant firing proved futile against the concealed ban- dits. The fugitives evaded their pursuers without receiv- ing the least injury. They succeeded in killing one of the bloodhounds, and several others were wounded. The pursuers sent to Hot Springs for reinforcements, and to Little rock for bloodhounds. A dozen men from the Hot Springs started when the despatch left, and they would be joined by others. Governor Berry has taken active steps towards suppressing the desperadoes, and his action is heartily approved. Fatal Railway Accident in Germany.\u2014A terrible railway accident occurred at Steglitz on Sunday night. Steglitz is a favourite place of resort of Berliners, and lies on the Potsdam and Magdeburg railway, three mile\u00df to the south-west. The accident, which may be called a massacre, stands probably unique in the annals of railway disasters. It being both Sunday and the Sedan anniversary, the place was crowded with excur- sionists to the Schuetzenfest and other festivities in honour of the day. By ten a crowd of about 500 persons filled the platform of the railway station watting for the return train. When the latter arrived, after some delay on the up line the barriers still remained closed to await the passing of the Cologne night express, which leaves Berlin at 9*50 p.m. Suddenly, however, the pressure of the impatient crowd foroed the barriers aside, and despite the efforts of the railway officials, hundreds rushed across the down line to enter the cars. At that very moment the express came tearing along, and although the driver, on seeing the danger signals displayed at the last moment, applied the brakes, the train dashed right through the mass of people covering the line, and annihilated everything in its way. One terrible cry of anguish arose even above the thunder of the train, and all was over. The details of this terrible scene, lasting only a few seconds, as narrated by eye witnesses, are almost too harrowing for repetition. Forty persons, of whom 17 Were men, 18 women, and five chil- dren, were instantly killed, and about 25 wounded. All the victims belong to the artisan and labouring classes. For a distance of 100 yards the line was covered with bodies, all shockingly mutilated, and human fragments. Of one family ofrfive persons only one boy escaped. The killed include four married couples, five members of the Shooters' Company, with the flagbearer and three artil- lery corporals. One of the latter had both legs and his heavy sabre cut through as with a knife. One girl had nearly reached the local train when the draught caused by the express throw her under the locomotive. One woman had both lags out off, and on being carried into the waiting-room gave birth to a dead child and expired. Another woman and a sailor la the Imperial navy were completely decapitated. A child had one hand cut off, and one body was entirely divested of clothing. The driver of the express train bad to be relieved, being un- able to proceed after witnessing the scene of carnage. His locomotive was covered with pieces of flesh, bones, rags, and drenched with blood. The line remained Mocked for hours, while detachments of firemen and soldiers gathered the remains of the victims by torch- light. . -\u25a0-\u2022> \u25a0' v, .

In the district of Tjiringen the los 3 of life is estimated at 10,0' JO. Some estimates place the total loss of life in tho Straits through the eruption at over 30,000. The Comptroller and Assistant Resident at Tjiringen, together with a lieutenant employed in the Topographic Service, were among those who perished by the eruption. Search is still being made for five Europeans known to have been at Anjer at the time of the eruption. Two vessels of the American squadron in Asiatic waters have been ordered to proceed to the Straits of Sunda to examine the state of affairs, (Daily Newt Telegram. ) New York, Sept. 2. The disturbances began on the island of Krakatoa on Saturday, August 2\"jth, when deep rumblings were distinctly audible at Suraperta and Bntavia. Little ! alarm was felt at first, but within a few hours showers ef stones began to fall, and all through the ni?bt showers of red-hot stones and ashes fell. By morn- ing all communications with Anjer on the Strait i of Sunda were destroyed, bridges being wrecked and roads rendered impassable. Tiie disturbances had extended beneath the waters of the Strait, and they were boiling and hissing violently, while great waves dashed on Java's shores. The temperature of the sea rose nearly 20 degrees. Far away at Madura, more than 300 miles distant, furious waves were lashed into mountains of foam as they came rolling in. The rumblings gradually became more and more dis- tinct, and by noon of the same day Maha Meru, the Im-gest of ths volcanoes, was belching forth flames at an alarming rate. This eruption soon spread to Gunung (luntur, and many other minor mountains, until more tiian a third of the 45 craters ot Java were either in active eruption or seriously threatening it. Just before dusk a great luminous cloud formed over Gunung Guntur. and the crater of that volcano began to emit euorrnous streams of white and sulphurous mud and lava, which were rapidly succeeded by explosions, followed by tremendous showers of cinders and enor- mous fragments of rock, which were hurled high into the air and scattered in all directions, carrying death and destruction with them. With these terrible erup- ' tions came sympathetic demonstrations from tiie sea. Overhanging clouds were so surcharged with electricity that at one time more than fifteen huge waterspouts were i een. Men. women, and children rushed in terror from their tottering dwelling-places, filling the air with shrieks of horror. Hundreds were unable to get out before the houses fell, and weie buried beneath great masses of rocks and mud. On Sunday evening, the shocks and eruptions increased in violence, and ihe island seemed threatened with submersion. At the s une time enormous waves began to dash with greater force upon the shores, coming in some p'.aces far up into the interior ; and great chasms opened in thi earth, threatening to engulf the people and buildings. . About midnight the most frightful scene of all took place. Suddenly an enorm- ous luminous cloud, similar to that over Gun- ung Guntur, but much greater in extent, formed over the Kandang range of mountains which skirt the south-east coast of the island. This cloud gradually increased in size until it formed a canopy lurid red cad whitish gray over a wide extent of territory. During this time the eruptions increased, and streams of lava poured incessantly down the sides of the mountains into the valleys, sweeping everything before them. About two o'cioc on Monday morning, this great cloud suddenly broke into small sections and vanished, and when daylight came it was seen that an enormous tract of land had disappeared, extending from Point Capucin, on the south, to Negery Passoerang, on the north and west, to the lowest point, covering about 50 square miles. Here were situated the villages of Negery and Negerj Babawang. : None of the inhabitants of these places escaped death. This section of the island was less densely populated than the other portions, and the loss of life was com- paratively small, although it must have aggregated 15,000. The entire Kandang range of mountains, ex- tending along the coast in a semicircle for about 6.> miles, bad gone out of sight. The waters of Welcome Bay, in the Sunda Straits, and Pepper-Bay on the east, and tbe Indian Ocean on the south, had rushed in and formed a sea of turbulent waters. (>n Monday night, tbe volcano of Papandayang was in an active state of paroxysmal eruption, which Was accompanied by detonations which are said to have been heard for many miles away. In Sumatra three distinct j columns of flame were seen to rise from a mountain to I a vast height, and its whole surface was soon covered with fiery lava streams which spread to great dis- j tancss on ail sides. Stones fell for miles around, and i black fragmentary mattsr carried into the air j caused total darkness. A whirlwind accompanied i this eruption, by which house-roofs, trees, | men, and horses were carried into the air. The quantity of ashes ejected was such as to cover the ground and the roots of the houses at Denamo to the depth of several inches. Suddenly the scene changed. The mountain was split into seven parts without a moments warning, and where Papan- daying had stood alone were now seven distinct peaks, in the opening seams of which could be seen great balls of molten matter. From the fissures poured forth clouds cf steam and black lava, which flowing in steady streams, ran slowly down the mountain sides, i forming beds 200 or 300 feet in extent. One of the most singular incidents was the sudden rising on the forenoon of Tuesday of 14 new volcanic mountains in the Straits of Svmda, forming a complete chain in almost a straight line betweet Point St. Nicholas on the Java coast, and Hoga Point on the coast of Sumatra, almost on the tops of what had been Merak and Middle Islands, which Stmk into the sea on the previous day. At the entrance to Batavia was a large group of houses extending along the shore, aud occupied by Chinamen. This portion of j the city was entirely destroyed, and of 25,000 Chinese who lived on tiie swampy plains, it is hardly probable tbat more than 5,000 managed to save their lives. They stuck to their homes till the waves.came and washed them away, fearing torrents of flame and lava more than torrents of water. Of the 3,500 Europeans and 'Ymericans in Batavia, |00 perished at Anjer. The European and American j quarter was first overwhelmed by rocks, mud, and lava j from the crater, and then the waters came up and swallowed the ruins, leaving nothing to mark the site, and causing the loss of about 200 ItVes of the inhabit- ants and those who sought refuge there. Bantam was entirely' covered by water, and .1,200 to 1,500 are be- lieved to have been drowned. The island of Serang j was completely inundated, and not a soul sur- Tired. At Cheribon there was no great flood of water, but the loss of life and property by falling looks and lava must have been considerable, j BirtinzoDg suffered seriously, as did Samarang, Jog- i jakerta, Sourakerta, and Sourabaya. The thousand ! temples at Brambaman were greatly damaged, and seme of them destroyed. The dome of the noted Temple of Borobodo was crushed in by falling rocks. The town of Tamerang was swept away by lava, and fully half the population, mostly Javanese, numbering about 1,800, perished. At Speezwyk, red-hot rocks set fire to the houses and swept away all the thickly- settled portions of the town. About 10 bazaars belong- ing to Europeans were destroyed. The river Jacatana, on the banks of which Batavi* is situated, was so com- pletely dammed by lava and debris that its course was changed, and from Franien Bastion it flowed down through Tygers Street and joined the waters of the River Emerades, swelling that stream to such an ex- tent that it rose high on the Castor batteries. Figelenking was almost totally destroyed, and a large number of lives lost. Tha island of Onius, five miles off of the mouth of the Targerang River, and 20 miles east of Batavia, was completely inundated and the boating dock totally destroyed. Baby and Cheriboo islands lost a few houses and inhabitants upon them. In Batavia tho roof of tha Governor's house was crushed in by a mass of mud, and three servants were killed. Midah Island, 10 miles off on the coast of Java, was almost wholly engulfed. The towns of Anjer, Tjiringine, and Telokbelong are reported as destroyed, and all lighthouses alone: tho Sunda Strait have disap- peared. The aspect of the Strait is much changed, and the navigation is dangerous. Some 900 inhabitants of the town of Waronge are known to have been killed, and at Talatoa, on the coast, 300 bodies have been found. From all over the island come reports of loss of life f-.nd property, and it is thought that the estimate of 75,000 will not prove excessive. On the lowlands of Eatavia, where the waters have receded, hundreds of bruised and mangled bodies are lying exposed. Amsterdam, Sept. 3. It is not yet possible to collect tho data on which a trustworthy calculation can be founded. In any case the loss of life is expected by competent judges to turn out vastly larger than any estimate hitherto published. In North Bantam there were till recently half-a-million Javanese inhabitants, but a considerable migration has taken place, owing to the diminishing productivity of tho soil or\" late years. Nevertheless, it is considered pro- bable that from SO,OOO to 100,000 natives have perished in this district, as the population of Anjer and Tjiringen alone was nearly CO,OOO. An extensive plain of volcanic stone has been formed in the sea near Lam- pong, Sumatra, which renders communication impos- sible with Telokbetong aad the south-west of Java. The Hague, Sept. 4. An official despatch states that Telok Ectong, in Sumatra, has probably been totally destroyed. No news has bean received from Lampong.

The Dutch Conlroleur at Hatimbong, which forms the extreme south-eastern point of Lampong, has been saved, along with all the members of his'family.

Not a vestige of the place now remains. A fort was built there many years sgo, and in 1877 extensive quarries were opened in the neigh- bourhood in order to supply stone for the construction of the new piers and dock 3 in the harbour of Batavia. There were other extensive industries carried on at the | spot, including railway and ironworks, and there was I also a large dynara'te store connected with the quarries. 1 The latter were 300 feet deep, and had within the past five or six years supplied not less i than a million and a-half tons of rock. Altogether i there were some thousands of labourers employed at i Merak. They were mostly natives, the number of the ; Europeans having dropped off since , the completion of | the Batavia harbour works. The dwelling-houses, ' shops, and business offices stood on an elevated site, about 150 feet above tho level of the sea. Of tho ' population of Merak it has now been ascertained that, with th* exception of one European book- keeper and two natives, every soul has been : drow.ied. There is not a building left ! standing, and every bit of property, including all the ! stores and raw materials, has been completely swept '. away.

ON THE FENCE. Mr. Hiram 8. Maxim, the well-known American inven- tor and artillerist, who now manages the gunworks at \u25a0ritb, on the Lower Thames, has been giving his views on English labour to the New York Sun. We have not space to reproduce the interview, much as we should like to do bo, but we are certainly of opinion that Mr. Maxim hits several nails on the head, and that unless British em- ployers unite to resist some ot the absurd rules of the Trades Unions they might as well \" shut up 6hop\" at once. Mr. Maxim points out that in England the Trade Union rules permit a man to manage ouly one self-acting lathe, whereas in France and Germany one man can easily run four to six. The same with planing-machiues and milling-machines; whereas in Paris Mr. Maxim saw one young girl running as many as fifteen milling-machines. One particular part of the Maxim gun has to be milled, and the Trade Union rules forbade that to be done in less than a day and a quarter. One day a skilful German mechanic applied for work, was put ou, and did twelve of these parts daily\u2014a l ? also could anv other man who did his work conscientiously. Mr. Maxim cites the cause of the loss of our wire trade. Our Trade Union men decline to move in any way; the Germans accepted their em- ployers' propositions, and they now have the wire trade. Mr. Maxim tells much more of the same kind; but wiiy go on? Why complain of bad trade and the success of foreign competition, when we calmly and tamely .v;quie*ce in the enforcement of rules the tyranny of which is only ex- ceeded by their utter insanity? We cannot hope to suc- ceed if we go into the international tight with these Trade Union ropes around our necks.\u2014The Ironmonger, April 29, U9a. THE \"STRIKE\" AT LEICESTER. To the Editor of the Journal. Sib,\u2014Your correspondent, 14 Veritas,\" must have worked himself to a terrible state when he penned the letter published in your issue of April 13th. Not satis- fied with announcing the well-known facts of the Leicester lock-out as \" barefaced representations,\" he must deliberately make it appear that I advocate strikes. Gooduess knows where he gob the idea from ! Certainly not from my letter to your paper. He surely canuot have read my letter, or his own comrnon-sense must tell him that he is doing me an irreparable injury with his mis-statements. Let \" Veritas \" say what he will, the seven laws or commandments, the real cause of the unfortunate lock- out, were issued by the employers three months pre- vious to February, and in doing this the employers knew very well that the time of the season suited them, if their men should object: and for not accepting the exacting and cruel condition of the employers, the men were locked out in February. \" Veritas \" contends that \" the' strike' was arranged by agitaton, to take place at a given time in February, when the masters would be most inconvenienced.\" That is very good, when the employers were responsible for the dispute, when they have discredited the services of well-known men to arbitrate, when they have determined to ex- haust the Union funds, &c. \"When objeoting to the seven laws of the employers, the men simply said, to qnote the London Timet, \" Your business is not entirely yours; it is ours as well; since our liberty, our time, and our health are, or may be, involved in it.\" According to public opinion, they are on impregnable ground; and when the true nature of the issue is understood, they will not want for sup- port. But tho employers have made up their minds that the claims of capital and machinery are absolute. The employers cannot say they have not been mak- ing profits, for the following reason : \u2014The Leicester Co-operative Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Society, commencing its business in 1886 with a capital of \u00a3400, has made profits for the eight years amounting to Jt'8,240. It is rather interesting to know that the \" fool- ish and ill-advised men might be earning \u00a32 or \u00a33 a week,\" when, as a matter of fact, the majority of the men are seeking for a minimum wage of 265. and 275. But these facts do uot trouble 11 Veritas \" 1 I know very well there is a class of people ready to blame the men for driving trade out of the country, whenever a trade dispute occurs\u2014of course, it is the men's fault, according to their narrow-minded way of thinking. No, not the employers; who, in accumulat- ing large fortunes, compel their men to work under the most demoralising conditions, \" with results,\" as Carlyle would say. But on reading my last weekly paper, I came across the following paragraph, extracted from an American journal, \" China is going to be the world's workshop in the near future, and her factories, manned with labour which ten cents, a day will be big wages, will undersell everybody.\" Query: What will the English and American workmen have to live on, to compete with the Chinese? \" Veritas's \" vituperations against the Trade Union- ist leaders generally are eharaoteristic, and add greatly to his mental capacity (?). Comparisons are odious, but he must forgive me if I quote Mr. Gladstone's opinion of the same class of men. In speaking to Leeds delegates the other day, Mr. Gladstone said\u2014\" They (leaders of the dook strike, ooal strike, &c.) have already shown a remarkable capacity for the exercise of power, and this is in the character of the men whom they have chosen to represent, and who have sent them to the House of Commons.\" \" Hazel\" does not hail from Bradford, and he is sorry to know that a strike has taken place there.

Sib,\u2014lt is somewhat surprising that an occurrence of a singular and unusual character should have escaped general observation, and that, so far as I am aware, no mention whatever has beon made of tho phenomenon in the local or any scientific papers. I havo seen, near the W. coast of Africa, the red fogs of the Atlantic Ocean. I may also remark that their cause has been traced to the vast swamps and lagoons of the Pampas in the La Plata region of S. America, where the vegetation, after the rainy season, is so luxuriant, that, upon its decay in the succeeding period of drought, the red spores of a fungus, which have been fostered in countless multitudes on the rank herbage, are swept away and borne aloft on the wings of the mighty winds to whioh those regions are sub- ject, so as to occasion the phenomena of red fogs and sea-dust. Their origin was long shrouded in mystery, and they have been known to extend across Northern Afriea, and even as far as Italy and Greece. However, to resume. On Saturday, the 30th ult., after frequent rain-storms during the week which fol- lowed the memorable cyclone of the previous Sunday, the morning was fine but gusty. About 3 p.m., an immense bank of dark, lurid oloud gathered in the N.W. The wind rose, and in a few minutes the dark- ness became so intense that it was impossible to read indoors excepting quite close to the window. Rain fell heavily in large drops, whioh, when collected, was of almost inky blackness. The unusual colour of the water was noticed in a wide distriet around Belvoir Castle\u2014extending from WooUthorpe on the E. to Red- mile on the W.\u2014not only in the villages, but also in tho open country, where the water ran black on tho highways and in the ditches and ponds. The rain- water was charged with such an amount of black sus- pended matter as to render it utterly uufit for washing purposes, neither did it deposit or become clear in the course of two weeks. It is a remarkable fact that there was a similar downpour of oolonrod rain about the same time on the following day (Sunday)\u2014only that the water was less intensely black. As to the cause of this very unusual meteoric occur- rence, it conld not possibly be due to soot, since tho water was not alkaline in its behaviour with litmus, and the roofs of buildings had been washed by rain many times during the previous week. There are one or two probable hypotheses whioh may be hazarded, via., either a volcanic or eosmio origin. The tremendous voloanio outburst at Krakatoa, in the Straits of Sunda, about ten years ago, may be adduced as having some boaring on the subject\u2014the effects of whioh, in the case of Krakatoa, lasted many weeks, and were even seen in England, in the display of the most brilliant and gorgeous sunsets witniu living memory, and by the prolongation of daylight for fully an hour beyond the time when night should have thrown her filmy veil over earth and sea.

Reccnt Glotnng Sunsets.\u2014Mr. Norman Lockyer lias brought the light of science to bear on the atmospheric phenomena which have lately been surprising and delighting Europe. It will be remembered that in August last .there was in one of the Java islands, Krakatoa, the most destructive volcanic eruption on record. The theory is that the force of the explosion carried away par- ticles of volcanic dust to the highest regions of the atmosphere, where they have become luminous through the aqueous vapour which surrounds the globe. An atmosphere at le:ist 40 miles deep clothes the earth. An aqueous vapour in great part composes it, and forms the reflecting medium. Generally the sunset tints are due to that aqueous vapour, which vibrates under the sun's rays. According to the density of the vapour, as it absorbs or intercepts one colour or another, the light it reflects is white, blue, violet, or red. Meteorologists have been enabled to track Krakatoa in solution from its original site in the Straits of Sunda to the skies above Java, to Madras, and other points in Southern India, to the Seychelles and Mauritius, to the Cape and the Gold Coast, to Brazil, Venezuela, and Trinidad. In the Seychelles and Brazil at the end of August and beginning of Septem- ber the sun had been as pale as the moon. Dr. Moldrum and Mr. Lockyer aro of opinion that the exploded frag- ments of Krakatoa and its volcanic roots have been dyeing European skies as they shrouded Java. Gradually the veil has become thinner and feebler. It has ceased to have power to hide the sun, or turn its face pale and silver. No longer do the sunbeams reach the earth blue and green and red as in Ceylon and Trinidad. Yet the dust of the dead mountains and crater has been here as real as at the instant of its fiery ejection, if less solid and deep. Though it could not subjugate the sun in its strength, it has had force to prolong its setting and to determine the tone of the after-glow \" On the 26th and 27th of last August there occurred the climax of the most tremendous volcanic eruption which, perhaps, the world has ever seen during historic times. In the course of it an island, 3000 ft. high or thereabouts, entirely disappeared. The usual volcanic products, includ- ing the finest particles both solid and vapourous, were ejected into the air to a height that no man will ever say, since for many miles round the scene of these devastating forces noon was as black as night, and darkness was over all the land for 36 or 40 hours. The scale on which the work was done was such that even the noise, the weakest part of it, was heard at a distance of 2000 miles. The shivering of the island produced a wave of water 100 ft. high, which destroyed everything over which it swept, and left its mark on tidal registers nearly all over the world. There was a British ship in the middle of all this horror, and surely no master mariner has ever had such a story to tell as Capt. Watson of the Charles Ball. At 3*30 on the 26th he was near the island of Krakatoa, in the Straits of Sunda. He heard above the ship and all around a strange sound as of a crackling fire, solid matter apparently, or whatever it was, being propelled with alarming velocity to the north- east. At 5 the roaring noise continued and increased; pumice stones hot and large fell on the deck; skylights, heads, and feet had to be protected from the downpour. After tbis a steady fall of a smaller kind, blinding to the eyes and speedily covering the decks three or four inches deep, and then * an intense blackness covered the sky and land and sea. The blinding fall of sand and stones, the intense blackness above and around us, broken only by the incessant glare of various kinds of lightning and the con- tinued explosive roars of Krakatoa, made our situation a truly awful one.' Bad as it was, it was to get worse, as the following statement in Capt. Watson's own words shows:\u2014 \"At 11 p.m., having stood off from the Java shore, wind strong from the south-west, the island, west-north-weet, 11 miles distant, became mere visible, of fire appearing to ascend and descend between the sky and it, while on the south-west end there seemed to be a continued MH ot balls of white fire; the wind, though strong, was hot and choking, sulphurous, with a smell as of burning cinders, some of the pieces falling on us being like inn cinders and the lead from a bottom of 30 fathoms up quite watm.

Sir, \u2014At the special general meeting of the members of tne Lincolnshire Chamber of Agriculture and the Land Agents' and Tenants' Rights Valuers' Association, held at Lincoln on the 30th of November, it was resolved That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable to adopt the undermentioned scale of allowances as fair and reasonable compensation under part 3 of the first schedule of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1883, to be substituted by agree- ments for compensation under the Act, viz. 1. ror one-third of the cost of linseed cake, cotton cake, rape cake, or malt culm, and one-sixth of the cost of corn cake, malt, or other manufactured feeding stuffs of similar inanurwl vahu, which have been consumed on the farm during tne last year of the tenancy; and for one-sixth of the cost of linseed cake, cotton cake, rape cake, or malt culm, and one- twelfth of the cost of corn cake, malt or other inamijacturecl feeding stuffs of similar manurial value which shall have been consumed on the farm during the preceding year of the tenancy. , , . ~ . I write to ask the meaning of the words above in italics, ana to what they refer ? How far do they go 1 I consider them very vague and unsatisfactory. Out other munv i f(ictuT\u20acd fccdwm stuffs may be counted on the fingers of one hand. Why, then, are they not enumerated ? Do they refer to lamb food. In my opinion the most valuable autumn food for lambs ever invented. Do they refer to barley meal? Every farmer uses some, many6ome thousands of stones a year, in the feeding of pigs, &c. My experience teaches me that pig manure beats all other for sand land, and is as good as most others for any kind of land. Is oatmeal or crushed oats included? If not they ought to be; it grows young stock better than any other food, it is safer than any other, and its manurial value is quite as great as the allowance. Is the desirable but diuretic pea, the feeding but flatulent bean, to be left out in the cold ? I hope not; they are exceed- ingly rich in nitrogen, and consequently invaluable as an assistant food and as manure. Will maize be allowed for ? 1 was very much amused at the meeting of the Chamber of Agriculture a few weeks ago, to which friends were invited, to see the expression of pious horror depicted on the face and in the uplifted hands of an \"Old Fogie,\" who declared \"We can't admit maize; our cart horses eat it.\" This was in answer to a proposed but not seconded resolu- tion, that maize be inserted instead of malt and corn cakc ; thus trying to still further play into the foreigners' hands. If maize isof any manurial value, and in the lasttrialsat Wobum it has beaten the very much Voelcker-vaunted decorticated cottoncakes. What think you to that, my countrymen? And asaflcsh-formeritbeat it hollow, as everyone mightexpect it would. Considering that our cart horses spend 10 hours in the stable, seven on the farm, and one on the roads, we have submitted quite long enough to the unjust practice of having the cake they consume all strictly deducted from valuations. The old Lincolnshire tenant-right custom has lost this county thousands of pounds a year in moat alone through encouraging the use of cotton and rape and discouraging the use of our home-grown feeding stuffs, and many more thousands still have, from the same causc, been put into the foreigners' pockets which now would have been more appreciated by landlords and tenants alike had they been left in our own. If this suicidal policy- had not been in vogue, would oats and grinding barley be at 9d. a stone ? I think not. I wish to extend and not curtail the privileges of the farmers, and there is no privilege they enjoy so much as that of grumbling, and no grumbling they practice more than against the Government of the day for fostering foreign trade at the expense of our own produc- tions. If we do not insist on home produce being put on the same footing as foreign in our tenant rights, we must rendar ourselves liable to the retort \" that season comes, Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated.\" (I hope I may be pardoned using it.) First cast out the beam that is in thine own eye, then shalt thou see to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's (Government's) eye.\u2014l thank you for the insertion of this letter, and remain, sir, j'Our obedient servant, W.

No fewer than eight great mountains \u2014some of them active volcanoes, but most of them hitherto unknown in that character \u2014have almost simul- taneously burst into eruption with effects of amazing width of range. The province of Mendoza itself is described as devastated by vast masses of volcanic cinders deep enough to stop the movement of railway trains, while the dust in the atmosphere is dense enough to shut out the sunlight, and sulphurous gases have rendered the air poisonous and unbreathable. But hundreds of miles away from Mendoza places as remote from one another as Valparaiso and Santiago on the Pacific and Buenos Aires on the Atlantic are heavily powdered with volcanic dust. The terrors of the event are accentuated by shocks of earthquake violent enough in many places to pro- duce great chasms in the earth. Clearly there is here the material of one of the greatest tragedies attribut- able to the liberation of the natural forces, and it will be strange indeed if a very harrowing tale has not to be told when all that has happened in Mendoza is revealed It is significant that even now the authorities of the Argentine are making provisional arrangements for the evacuation of the 80,000 inhabitants of the province. The chain of the Andes is one of the \" youngest\" of the world's uplifts, and there have been many indications that the process of its upheaval has not come to an end. This outburst, with its focus in the giant volcano of Tin- guiririca, speaks of a renewal of mountain building on a formidable scale. It is far from improbable that effects of so great a movement may become visible even in Britain. The last volcanic event comparable with this one was the eruption of Krakatoa, in the Straits of Sunda, between Java and Sumatra, in 1883; and the volume of volcanic dust thrown into the atmosphere on that occasion was so vast that it spread itself right round the globe. Months after the eruption this dust cloud produced the most wonderful sunsets ever seen in Britain, and similar effects, but in diminishing intensity, were observable during the three following years. There is a strong presumption that the eight Andean giants will produce effects even more considerable.", "id_issue": "0000564_19320413", "id_newspaper": "0000564", "page": "0006", "title": "THE ANDEAN ERUPTIONS"}, {"content": "MOST FEARSOME MOUNTAINS IN THE WORLD fTVHE Andes have been said by many travellers to be the most fearsome mountain range in the world. They have a terrible power of striking fear into the heart of even the most casual observer. Running almost the whole length of South America they have witnessed many terrifying cataclysms of nature. Scarcely a year passes with- out an earthquake or a volcanic eruption sending terror into the hearts of the people who live round their slopes. To-day they are a place of dread to the people of Chili and Argentina. Subterranean rumblings and the threat of Descabezado, a volcanic peak of the Andes for long thought to be extinct, have inspired great fears for the future. Threat to Town. Between the frontier of Argentina and Chili the air is almost unbreathable. The fumes cover an area of 300 miles, a district as large as England, while in many parts of Argentina far from the immediate vicinity of Descabezado thick showers of ash are falling. In Chili the giant volcano Tinguiricia and a number of minor volcanoes have erupted and belched fire and ashes over many towns. The province of Mendoza appears to be the greatest sufferer, as it was almost three-quarters of a century ago. Giant cracks in the earth in this district threaten to engulf the whole town of Marlague. In 1860 the town of Mendoza itself was totally destroyed by an earthquake and the fire which followed. Twelve thousand lives were lost, and not a building in the town was left standing. Eight years later there were 25,000 deaths as the result of an earthquake which devastated Peru and Eouador, while in more recent times \u2014in 1906\u2014the death- roll from an earthquake in the Valparaiso district was set down at 2500. Run in Cycles. Seismic disturbances in South and Central America appear to run in cycles. Thus between the years 1859 and 1875 there were four great earthquakes in that part of the world, resulting in a gigantic loss of life, at least 50,000 being killed. The damage to property must have run into many millions of ponds. Again in the period 1902-1906, midway between the first series of disasters and the present, there were two earthquakes, which were also attended by a large death- roll. Last year considerable damage was caused by eruptions of the volcano Acatenango, which almost completely destroyed three towns in Guatemala. Active Volcanoes. There are still a large number of active volcanoes in South and Central America. Izalco, in Salvador, Masaya and Amatitlan, in Nicaragua, Cotopaxi, Sangay, in the Andes of Quito, still erupt periodically, and they have been active for thousands of years. Thought to be Extinct. Perhaps the most disturbing feature of the present eruptions is . the fact that Descabezado, which was generally thought to be extinct, is definitely active. It is, however, practically impossible to tell when the volcanic activity of a mountain is at an end. Some volcanoes remain dormant or quiescent for centuries, and when an eruption does occur after such prolonged repose it is invariably exceedingly violent. It was such an eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum, while the terrific outburst of Krakatoa, in our own day, occurred after the volcano had been in repose for two centuries, and was to all appearances extinct. Dust Travels to Britain. So violent are the present eruptions in South America that it is believed possible that clouds of ashes may reach Europe. If so, this will be remarkable, but by no means unprecedented. When Krakatoa erupted fine ashes were carried to a height of 17 miles, while all over Britain for months afterwards there were gloriously coloured skies at sunrise and sunset, which were attributed to clouds of fine ash in the atmosphere. Less than half a day after the eruption of Heckla in 1845 the dust of the volcano was lying thick on Orkney and Shetland, while the ashes from Consequina, in 1835, were carried for over 700 miles.
